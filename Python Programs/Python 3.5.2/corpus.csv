"I was excited because this was obviously a test of [whether] I could eventually be groomed for taking over the department" he recalls. That discussion took place on Friday afternoon. On Monday everyone showed up for the meeting wondering where the boss was including Gordon. "It was completely gone from my memory that I was to run this meeting" he says. When the boss didn't show up everyone went back to their desks. Later in the day the boss came in and asked Gordon how the meeting went. "I said 'We didn't have the meeting you weren't here. I figured we'd have it when you came in.' And he looked at me completely dumbfounded like 'How is that even possible?'" Gordon has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He describes it as a feeling of paranoia. “You're always always on edge." He explains: “You never know when something is going to go horribly wrong. There's every chance it will. If my boss calls me I wonder what went wrong. If I get mail I wonder if I'm going to jail. You assume and expect that at any moment you're going to get sideswiped by something and it's something you did or forgot to do that is going to have severe repercussions.”  ADHD is a condition that both children and adults can have. The symptoms include an inability to focus being easily distracted hyperactivity poor organization skills and impulsiveness. Not everyone who has ADHD has all these symptoms. They vary from person to person and tend to change with age. Only in the last few decades have researchers realized that ADHD can last into adulthood. Experts say every adult with ADHD had it as a child too whether it was diagnosed or not. And most adults with ADHD weren’t diagnosed as children says Linda Walker an ADHD coach. She helps clients with time management organization and anything else they need to be successful in life. She’s also a committee chair for the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA).|

Sat Oct 08 14:00:23 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/W2qK4aT9nS, | 'Mindfulness' Approach Could Help You Stay Slim|, |['mindfulness' 'overeating' 'personal goals' 'dieting' 'lose weight' 'stay slim' 'weight maintenance'] |, |FRIDAY Sept. 30 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A weight-loss therapy that focuses on personal values and "mindful" decision-making may help people shed more pounds a new clinical trial suggests. Over one year people who received the therapy lost more than 13 percent of their initial weight on average. To put that into perspective current behavioral therapies typically help people drop 5 percent to 8 percent of their starting weight the study authors said. Researchers call the new approach acceptance-based behavioral therapy or ABT. The study authors said ABT addresses some of the biggest obstacles in keeping extra pounds off -- including the difficulty of resisting temptation. "The standard advice on weight loss only works if people are able to stick with it" said Evan Forman who helped develop ABT. He's a professor of psychology at Drexel University in Philadelphia. There is nothing new about using behavioral therapy to help people lose weight. But Forman said the standard approaches don't address the "main issue." "People are biologically driven to eat especially foods that are rewarding and taste good" he said. Through most of human history when food was scarce that was an asset Forman pointed out. Now when so many people are surrounded by calorie-laden temptations every day the biological drive to eat can be a problem. "It takes special skills to resist those temptations" Forman said. "It's hard to turn down pleasure and reward. But those skills can be learned." ABT aims to teach people those skills. The new clinical trial put the approach to the test by comparing it with standard behavioral therapy which only encourages reducing calories and increasing exercise. Forman's team recruited 190 overweight or obese adults and randomly assigned them to either ABT or standard treatment. People in both groups went to 25 group sessions over one year meeting with therapists with expertise in weight loss. Both groups received help with diet changes and exercise "problem solving" and dealing with food cravings. But ABT had added components. For one Forman said people chose a goal based on their "personal values" -- rather than aiming for a certain number on the bathroom scale.|

Possibly according to a new U.S. report that found for certain occupations the odds of suicide were significantly higher.  From 2000 to 2012 the overall rates of suicide for people aged 16 and older rose 21 percent the study found. That works out to an approximate increase from 13 to 16 suicides per every 100000 people in the United States. But among farmers fishers and foresters the suicide rate was dramatically higher -- at 85 suicides per 100000 people. For males in those jobs the rate was even greater. Their suicide rate was 90.5 suicides per 100000 according to the report. "People working in certain occupations are at greater risk for suicide due to job isolation a stressful work environment trouble at work and home lower income and education and less access to mental health services" said lead researcher Wendy LiKamWa McIntosh. She's a health scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  "Farmers have additional risk factors like social isolation and unwillingness to seek mental health services" McIntosh said. The report also noted that farmers' exposure to pesticides may affect their neurological system and contribute to depression. Other occupations that carried significantly higher-than-normal rates of suicide included construction and extraction with 53 suicides per 100000; and installation maintenance and repair with 48 suicides per 100000 the study found.  For construction workers the report authors suggested that a lack of steady work isolation and a fragmented community might play a role in their higher risk. The investigators theorized that people working in installation maintenance and repair may have long-term exposure to solvents that could damage their neurological systems. That might contribute to memory loss and depression the researchers suggested. Men working in fishing forestry or farming had the highest rates of suicide for their gender. Among women the highest rate was seen in those working in protective services such as policing and firefighting. Their rate was 14 per 100000. Men in the protective services field had a suicide rate of 34 per 100000 the report noted.|

"This study suggests that patients interested in bariatric surgery especially gastric bypass surgery should be able to lose a significant amount of weight and keep that weight off for a very long time" said study researcher Matt Maciejewski. He's a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham N.C. While other research has found that weight-loss surgery is the most effective treatment for obese patients there is less data on long-lasting effects. The new study is notable because of the decade-long follow-up said Maciejewski who is also a research career scientist at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In the two-part study Maciejewski's team first looked at the results of about 1800 men and women who had gastric bypass surgery. The investigators compared weight changes in gastric bypass surgery patients to weight changes in more than 5300 obese veterans who had no weight-loss surgery or formal weight-loss treatment.  Gastric bypass surgery involves making the stomach smaller and attaching the lower part of the small intestine directly to the stomach so much of the small intestine is bypassed. After surgery people feel much fuller faster. The surgery also appears to alter gut hormones gut bacteria and metabolism according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). At the study's one-year mark those who had the bypass had lost 31 percent of their starting weight but the non-surgical patients had lost just 1 percent.  At 10 years the researchers had weight information on 564 of the nearly 1800 patients who had the gastric bypass. Only 19 of them had regained so much weight that they were nearly back to their starting weight; the rest kept off the weight. Compared to the non-surgical group the bypass group weighed 21 percent less than at the start of the study.|
Mon Apr 04 12:54:19 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/hqLFrBk4lv, | Berries: Big Health Benefits in Small Packages|, |['berries' 'antioxidants' 'flavonoids' 'resveratrol' 'heart disease' 'cancer' 'inflammation'] |, |April 4 2016 -- You already know berries are good for you. But researchers are finding more and more reasons to eat these nutritious powerhouses. Here’s one of the latest juicy details: Berries may lower the risk of erectile dysfunction. Other recent studies show they may play a potential role in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and help with weight loss. “Berries do warrant the hype that they get” says Barbara Shukitt-Hale PhD a USDA staff scientist with the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. “And where we are now in terms of research is leaps and bounds ahead of where we were 10 years ago.” The fruits -- no matter what type -- are linked with lower risks of cancer heart disease and inflammation Shukitt-Hale says. But the link to erectile dysfunction is new. In a study of more than 25000 men those who ate the greatest amount of blueberries and citrus fruits were reported to have a nearly 20% lower risk of ED compared to those who ate the smallest amounts. Researchers can’t prove that eating berries caused the drop in risk and they say more study is needed. So what makes berries so beneficial? They have several different compounds that are good for you. Some of the most important: Berries boost a process called neurogenesis or making new neurons Shukitt-Hale explains. That may aid our memories and our ability to learn. They’re also involved in the brain’s "housecleaning" activities. They help clear out toxic proteins that build up in the brain such as tau and amyloid beta. Excessive amounts of those proteins are linked to Alzheimer's disease.|
Thu May 05 18:12:23 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/Dt72fj3wgi, | Widely Used Heart Drug Tied to Dementia Risk|, |['warfarin' 'atrial fibrillation' 'blood thinner' 'blood clots' 'dementia'] |, |THURSDAY May 5 2016 (HealthDay News) -- People with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation may have a heightened risk of developing dementia -- and the quality of their drug treatment may play a role a new study hints. Specifically researchers found patients on the clot-preventing drug warfarin showed a higher dementia risk if their blood levels of the medication were frequently too high or too low. And that was true not only for people with atrial fibrillation but also for those using warfarin for other reasons. Dr. Jared Bunch the lead researcher on the study said the findings uncover two potential concerns: People with atrial fibrillation may face an increased risk of dementia independent of warfarin use but warfarin might also contribute to dementia if the doses are not optimal. "If people's levels of warfarin were erratic their dementia risk was higher whether they had AF or not" said Bunch who was scheduled to present his findings Thursday at the Heart Rhythm Society's annual meeting in San Francisco. The results do not prove that either atrial fibrillation or warfarin are to blame according to Bunch a cardiologist at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray Utah. But he said there is reason to believe that both could contribute to dementia -- in part because of effects on blood flow to the brain. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia affecting about 3 million U.S. adults according to the Heart Rhythm Society. In it the upper chambers of the heart quiver instead of contracting efficiently. The condition is not immediately life-threatening but it can cause blood clots to form in the heart. If a clot breaks free and lodges in an artery supplying the brain that can trigger a stroke. Because of that people with atrial fibrillation often take medications that cut the risk of blood clots. Those include aspirin or anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin). Warfarin is a tricky drug to take Bunch explained: People need regular blood tests to make sure their warfarin levels are in the "therapeutic range" -- high enough to prevent clots but low enough to avoid internal bleeding. The doses typically have to be changed over time.|

Wed Sep 14 11:59:53 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/GJiqXs5rk6, | This May Ease Teens' Stubborn Concussion Symptoms|, |['concussion' 'concussion symptoms' 'lingering concussion symptoms' 'stubborn concussion symptoms' 'teens' 'adolescents' 'talk therapy' 'depression' 'anxiety'] |, |TUESDAY Sept. 13 2016 (HealthDay News) -- For teenagers with lingering symptoms after a concussion treatment that focuses on the "whole person" may speed their recovery a new small study suggests. The researchers tested the effects of so-called "collaborative care" for teens with persistent problems following a concussion. That meant they saw a team of health professionals who provided among other things "talk therapy" for their depression and anxiety. After six months those kids showed a speedier recovery than teenagers who'd received more typical care. "Typical" can vary because there are no guidelines on how to treat lingering concussion symptoms explained study author Carolyn McCarty a researcher at Seattle Children's Hospital. But traditionally she said doctors have largely used the "watchful waiting" approach where they monitor kids' progress as the brain injury heals. She said the findings show the value of actively treating the fallout of a concussion including mental and emotional symptoms. Kenneth Podell a neuropsychologist and director of the Houston Methodist Concussion Center agreed. "Concussions are treatable and this study demonstrates that active treatment will help you get better quicker" said Podell who was not involved in the research. The issue of sports-related concussion -- especially in young athletes -- has garnered growing attention in recent years McCarty pointed out. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 248000 U.S. children and teens land in the emergency room each year because of a concussion sustained in sports or recreational activities. But that figure only captures kids taken to the ER. A recent study estimated that the actual number of injuries is closer to 2 million a year but researchers said even that figure is probably too low. The more immediate symptoms of a concussion can include confusion headache dizziness sluggishness and nausea or vomiting. With rest most kids see their symptoms go away in a couple of weeks McCarty said. But some develop what's called post-concussive syndrome -- where symptoms like headache dizziness and sleep problems last a month or more. Depression or anxiety symptoms may set in too.|

The most common and devastating birth defect seen so far has been microcephaly a condition where the head and brain are abnormally small. Vision problems and malformed joints have also been documented recently. But researchers in Brazil wanted to track the prevalence of hearing loss among newborns with Zika-related microcephaly. "Other congenital infections can cause hearing loss which is diagnosed at birth or during later follow-up; however few data exist regarding hearing loss associated with confirmed congenital Zika virus infection" the researchers said in their report. In the analysis Mariana Leal of the Hospital Agamenon Magalhaes and the Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil and colleagues looked at 70 infants in Brazil who had been diagnosed with Zika-linked microcephaly. Subsequent hearing tests confirmed that almost 6 percent had hearing loss. "Congenital infection with Zika virus should be considered a risk factor for hearing loss" the researchers concluded. "Children with evidence of congenital Zika virus infection who have normal initial screening tests should receive regular follow-up because onset of hearing loss associated with other congenital viral infections can be delayed and the loss can be progressive" the study authors added. The findings were published Aug. 30 in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Hearing loss isn't the only worrisome news to surface recently about Zika's effect on infants: A case study suggested the virus can live and cause damage in newborns for at least two months after birth. That report published online Aug. 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine involved a baby boy born in January to a woman in Sao Paulo Brazil. Zika is typically transmitted via mosquito bites but sexual transmission can also occur. The mother developed symptoms of Zika illness -- rash fever headache swollen joints -- in week 26 of her pregnancy. The doctors suspect she got the infection through sexual contact with the baby's father who had traveled recently to a Zika-endemic region.|

"Street Norco is almost indistinguishable from brand-name Norco in appearance but can be lethal" said Dr. Patil Armenian of the University of California San Francisco. She is the lead author of a new case study involving the drug. The street drug combines fentanyl -- the synthetic opioid painkiller linked to the death of the musician Prince -- and a new synthetic opioid called U-47700. Neither of these ingredients is in brand-name Norco which contains acetaminophen and hydrocodone also an opioid or narcotic painkiller. "This new street drug's toxicity led to an unexpected cluster of fentanyl deaths in California this spring" Armenian said. Armenian and her colleagues launched their investigation after a female emergency room patient said she was exceedingly sleepy after her usual dose of medication and thought the color of her pill looked odd. The 41-year-old woman was treating her chronic back pain with regular Norco that she bought illegally according to the case study. After unknowingly taking a dose of the fake Norco the woman became unconscious within 30 minutes and was brought to the emergency department. Her blood had significant amounts of fentanyl and U-47700. The patient's pills had a bogus manufacturer's imprint and were beige instead of white. The report was published online July 27 in the journal Annals of Emergency Medicine. During March and April 12 fentanyl-related deaths and 40 additional cases of toxicity from fake Norco pills were reported in Sacramento and Yolo counties in northern California. Additional cases have occurred in the San Francisco area the study authors said. "In cases where there is a reasonable suspicion of opioid or opioid-like ingestion emergency providers should contact their local poison control center medical toxicologist or public health department" Armenian said in a journal news release. "This case highlights that fentanyl-laced Norco is spreading to other regions prompting emergency physicians to remain vigilant in their care" she added.|

Fri Jul 01 09:36:21 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/r9RdeIU0Jy, | Clinics Selling Unapproved Stem Cell 'Therapies'|, |['stem cells' 'stem cell therapies' 'clinics' 'stem cell clinics' 'aging' 'injuries' 'spinal cord injuries'] |, |THURSDAY June 30 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Hundreds of clinics across the United States are marketing unapproved stem cell treatments for conditions ranging from aging skin to spinal cord injuries a new study finds. In an online search researchers found at least 570 clinics offering unapproved stem cell "therapies." They tend to be concentrated in a handful of states -- including Arizona California Colorado Florida New York and Texas -- but are scattered across many other states too. Most often the clinics market stem cell procedures for orthopedic conditions such as arthritis and injured ligaments and tendons. This does have science behind it but is still experimental medical experts said. In other cases with little or no supporting evidence clinics hawked stem cell "facelifts" and therapies for serious conditions such as chronic lung disease Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. If these pricey stem cell treatments are unproven and unapproved by federal regulators how can these clinics exist? "I ask myself that question all the time" said Leigh Turner a bioethicist who worked on the study. Turner an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics said attention used to focus on "stem cell tourism" -- where people travel to countries such as China India and Mexico to get unproven treatments. "I think there's a misperception that everything here [in the U.S.] is regulated" Turner said. "But these clinics are operating here and on a relatively large scale." Stem cells are primitive cells with the potential to mature into various types of body tissue. Medical researchers have been studying the possibility of using stem cells to repair damaged tissue in a range of chronic ills -- with limited success so far. But the general public has heard about the "promise" of stem cells for years and it can be easy to be taken in by clinics' marketing tactics Turner said. Websites can for instance link to published medical studies that make their therapies seem legitimate Turner said. "These businesses can be quite savvy" he said. "I think it's asking too much to just tell consumers to be wary. We need to be asking why should these clinics be allowed to do this?"|

"The takeaway here is that job number one for U.S. employers is to reduce stress in the workplace" said poll director Robert Blendon. He is the Richard L. Menschel Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. The poll which included phone interviews with more than 1600 workers in the United States found that 44 percent think their job affects their overall health. And only 28 percent of those people believe the influence is positive. Among the 16 percent who think their job is taking a toll on their health are those with disabilities those with dangerous jobs those working more than 50 hours a week those working in retail and those earning low wages.  Stress is a significant problem among American workers the poll found. Forty-three say their job is contributing to their stress. Nearly 30 percent also say their job influences their eating and sleeping habits while 22 percent say the work they do affects their weight. Many construction workers those who work outside and health care professionals worry that their jobs could expose them to chemicals and contaminants. Others worry about stress breathing polluted air having accidents or sustaining work-related injuries. Only about half of the workers say they have access to wellness or health improvement programs through their employer. Thirty-four percent rate these programs as excellent while 24 percent say they are only fair or poor. Healthy food options are also scarce for many working Americans the poll found. More than half of those with factory or manufacturing jobs as well as those working in medical construction outdoor or retail jobs rate their workplace as only fair or poor in making healthy foods available. Additionally nearly 20 percent report working 50 or more hours a week but most of these people feel working overtime is important for their career and about half say they enjoy their long hours.|

Yet obese people with advanced kidney cancer seem to live longer than normal-weight or underweight patients a new study finds.  In one database of nearly 2000 patients with advanced kidney cancer those who were obese or overweight survived nearly 26 months compared to 17 months for those of normal weight. And overweight patients were 16 percent less likely to die during the study period the researchers reported.  Similar findings were uncovered using three other databases. The records of more than 7000 kidney cancer patients were reviewed by the study authors.  "Paradoxically when overweight individuals developed kidney cancer especially in its advanced metastatic form their disease progressed more slowly and they lived longer than their normal-weight counterparts" said lead researcher Dr. Toni Choueiri. Choueiri is director of the Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Choueiri's team could not find any differences in the tumors' DNA such as gene mutations that might account for the finding. But they did find that a difference in the rate at which genetic information was used by the cells to make proteins in a gene -- called fatty acid synthase (FASN) -- was decreased in obese patients compared with normal-weight patients. FASN is an essential protein for making fatty acids. High levels of FASN have been found in many types of cancer and are associated with poor outcomes including in kidney cancer Choueiri said. The decreased amount of FASN in obese and overweight kidney cancer patients might explain the better outcomes of these patients he suggested. Why these people produce less FASN isn't known Choueiri said. But finding ways to inhibit FASN might be a way to prolong survival in normal-weight patients he noted. Drugs that inhibit FASN have been in development for several years and may be a promising approach to cancer treatment Choueiri added. "We plan to test FASN inhibitors in an animal model as a possible therapy for kidney cancer" he said.|

Scientists found that 13 infants in Brazil who were exposed to the mosquito-borne virus during gestation had normal head size as newborns but subsequently experienced slower head growth. Eleven of these babies were diagnosed with microcephaly -- an abnormally small head and brain -- and other neurologic complications associated with Zika syndrome the researchers reported.  "Among infants of mothers exposed to Zika virus during pregnancy the absence of microcephaly at birth does not rule out congenital Zika virus infection or the presence of Zika-related brain abnormalities" according to a news release from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The findings from the U.S. and Brazilian research team underscore the need for continuing evaluation of newborns with possible Zika exposure during pregnancy the CDC release said. The findings also highlight the "importance of early neuroimaging for infants who were exposed to Zika virus prenatally" the agency added. Although these babies all tested positive for Zika exposure in the womb abnormal head growth wasn't detected until at least 5 months of age according to the report. The findings were published Nov. 22 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. More details on how the Zika virus affects infants and adults will be presented to international researchers meeting in Chicago next week. Most cases in the current crisis have occurred in Latin American countries. Three new studies from Brazil are scheduled for presentation at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. In one study researchers used CT imaging to examine the central nervous system of 16 newborns whose mothers were infected with Zika during pregnancy. The babies were found to have a number of brain abnormalities. "Our study proves that Zika virus infection can cause congenital brain damage in babies with and without microcephaly" study author Dr. Natacha Calheiros de Lima Petribu said in a society news release. She's with the department of radiology at Barao de Lucena Hospital in Recife Brazil.|

"Caregivers to patients who have spent at least seven days in the ICU [intensive care unit] commonly experience symptoms of depression for the full first year after ICU discharge" said study leader Jill Cameron. She is a researcher at the University of Toronto.  "A large portion of them improve over the year but a [sub] group does not" Cameron said. Surprisingly the ones who are most depressed "are not necessarily caring for the sickest patients" she added. Her team collected information on 280 caregivers of patients who had been in the ICU for seven days or longer on mechanical ventilation which helps patients breathe. It is needed for serious medical conditions such as respiratory arrest lung injury or traumatic brain injury. The caregivers were on average about 53 years old. Seventy percent were women often caring for a spouse. The researchers looked at characteristics of both caregivers and patients determining what might predict poor mental or physical health. The investigators evaluated the caregivers a week after the ICU discharge and then again three six and 12 months later. They used a standard scoring scale to assess risk of depressive symptoms or of clinical depression. Initially 67 percent had scores that indicated either depressive symptoms or clinical depression. At the one-year mark 43 percent had scores indicating either depressive symptoms or full-blown depression. Most improved over time but 16 percent did not the findings showed. None of the patients' characteristics -- such as severity of illness -- correlated with how depressed the caregivers were the study authors said. Younger caregivers said caregiving affected many of their other activities and those who were making under $39000 annually tended to be more depressed according to the report. The findings suggest that focusing help on caregivers with the sickest loved ones isn't the answer Cameron said. Dr. Eugene Grudnikoff a psychiatrist at Northwell Health's South Oaks Hospital in Amityville N.Y. agreed.|

That's the suggestion behind a new study although the researchers said the effect seems to be temporary. When the study participants weren't high long-term marijuana users were just as motivated as non-users according to researchers at University College London in England. The researchers believe their study is the first reliable test of a common belief that marijuana makes people less motivated to work.  To find out the investigators led two studies. In one 17 occasional pot users were asked to choose between an easy or more complex task to win money. When they were high people usually went for the easy task even though it paid less. A second study compared motivation levels of 20 long-term marijuana users to motivation levels of 20 people who used drugs other than marijuana (the "control" group). "It has also been proposed that long-term cannabis users might also have problems with motivation even when they are not high. However we compared people dependent on cannabis to similar controls when neither group was intoxicated and did not find a difference in motivation" lead author Will Lawn said in a university news release. "This tentatively suggests that long-term cannabis use may not result in residual motivation problems when people stop using it. However longitudinal research is needed to provide more conclusive evidence" he said. Lawn is a research associate in the department of clinical educational and health psychology. The study was published Sept. 1 in the journal Psychopharmacology.|

People diagnosed as chronic binge eaters can benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy a form of therapy that helps patients understand the reasons behind their actions. That understanding can then help them change their behavior said study lead author Kimberly Brownley. She's an associate professor with the University of North Carolina Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders. The new research review also identified prescription drugs that appear to help curb binge eating including second-generation antidepressants such as Prozac Zoloft and Wellbutrin. People with binge-eating disorder can also try a drug called Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine). It's currently the only FDA-approved medication for binge-eating disorder Brownley said. "We found strong evidence to support these three different forms of treatment" Brownley said. But it appears that there's no one-size-fits-all treatment. "We can't say 'Start with this treatment and then add this other treatment in' " Brownley said. "There's a lot more research to be done. But we have provided a good platform for physicians to figure out how to guide their patients' care." The new evidence review appears online June 28 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Binge-eating disorder affects about 3.5 percent of women and 2 percent of men in the United States according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. But it wasn't until 2013 that the American Psychiatric Association judged binge-eating disorder a true illness and included it in its diagnostic manual the DSM-5. Binge-eating disorder is different from bulimia because the person who binges doesn't feel compelled to purge the food afterwards. People with bulimia often try to prevent weight gain by vomiting using laxatives or overexercising after they've overeaten Brownley said. People who occasionally down a whole pint of ice cream or a family-size bag of chips in one sitting don't necessarily have binge-eating disorder pointed out Dr. Michael Devlin a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.|

Confirmation came from testing of fetal tissue which revealed the presence of the mosquito-borne virus NBC News reported. "CDC has confirmed the first case of Zika virus disease in a fetus in Puerto Rico" the agency said in a statement. "CDC conducted the laboratory test that confirmed the diagnosis and has shared the results with the Puerto Rico Department of Health." Zika is known to be endemic in mosquitoes on the island and more cases of birth defects such as microcephaly (too-small heads) in newborns are feared. "This case of Zika virus disease in a pregnancy saddens and concerns us as it highlights the potential for additional cases and associated adverse pregnancy outcomes" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Few details were given about the reported case and Puerto Rico officials did not reveal if the pregnancy ended in miscarriage or abortion NBC News said. "I want to urge any pregnant women with even the slightest concern of infection to go see a doctor" Puerto Rico Health Secretary Ana Rius said. So far Puerto Rico has recorded Zika infection in 18 pregnant women as well as 27 cases of Zika infection where the person was sick enough to require hospitalization. The CDC says that 48 pregnant women in the United States have been confirmed to have a Zika infection with 5 affected babies or fetuses being miscarried or having some evidence of birth defects such as microcephaly.|

"The results of this new study add urgency to the need for more screening of those with the condition and faster intervention" said senior study author Dr. Michael Polydefkis a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The study included 62 people including 52 with tingling and pain in their hands and feet -- a condition known as neuropathy. Diabetes is a common cause of neuropathy the researchers said. Thirteen participants had prediabetes meaning their blood sugar levels were higher than normal but not yet at the point of diabetes. Over three years the researchers found that those with prediabetes had damage over the entire length of small sensory nerve fibers rather than just at the longest ends first. The findings challenge current understanding of prediabetes-related nerve damage the researchers said. The study was published online April 11 in the journal JAMA Neurology. "I liken small-fiber neuropathy to the canary in the coal mine" Polydefkis said in a university news release. "It signals the beginning of nerve deterioration that with time involves other types of nerve fibers and becomes more apparent and dramatically affects people's quality of life" he explained. According to the American Diabetes Association you can reduce your risk of progressing from prediabetes to diabetes by losing 7 percent of your body weight (for example 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and by exercising moderately 30 minutes a day five days a week.|

Researchers found that when folks retire they tend to increase their physical activity sit less and sleep more soundly.  "Our study paints a positive picture of retirement" said lead researcher Dr. Melody Ding a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney's School of Public Health. "Retirees [in the study] were acquiring a healthier lifestyle. Factors that may have contributed to this include availability of time to be physically active and removal from sedentary jobs and work-related stress."  Whether or not these results would be the same in the United States isn't clear. "Retirement and the health benefits of retirement could be very context-specific" she said. "Life expectancy in Australia -- 82.1 years -- is a few years longer than that in the United States -- 78.7 and there are also different social welfare and health care systems" Ding said. "All of these factors may limit the 'generalizability' of our findings to the U.S."  The study tracked about 25000 Australians. The average age of those still working was just over 54. During slightly more than three years of follow-up about 3100 of the study participants retired.  After retirement study participants reported increased physical activity levels of about an hour and half a week. Retirees also sat around less -- cutting their sedentary time down by just over an hour each day. And compared to when they were working those who retired slept an average of 11 minutes more each day the research revealed. The study authors also noted that about half of the women smokers quit after retirement.  No significant link was found between retirement status and alcohol use or eating fruit and vegetables.  The average age for retirement in the United States is 62 according to a 2014 Gallup poll. Ding said the average retirement age in Australia is just over 63 years.  "I think it is important to plan for retired life with a positive mindset" she said. "Some people get anxious about retirement because they may lose a sense of purpose."|
Wed Jun 15 10:57:49 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/4plIsHjOUm, | Could More Whole Grains Help You Live Longer?|, |['whole grains' 'eating whole grains' 'lifespan' 'longevity' 'live longer' 'longer life' 'death' 'heart disease' 'cancer'] |, |MONDAY June 13 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Health experts have long urged people to swap their processed white grains for the whole-grain variety and new research suggests that advice might help you live longer. Researchers found that people who ate three or more servings of whole grains a day had a 20 percent reduced risk of premature death during the study period compared to those who ate fewer or no servings of whole grains. "The higher the whole grain intake the lower the death rate especially deaths from cardiovascular disease" said study author Dr. Qi Sun. He is an assistant professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Whole grains are so named because they contain the entire grain kernel including bran (outer husk) germ (nutrient-rich core) and endosperm (middle layer). Whole-grain foods include whole-wheat flour oatmeal brown rice and whole cornmeal.  When grains are refined they have been milled and that process removes the bran and the germ as well as fiber iron and many of the B vitamins. White breads white rice and white flour are all refined grains according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Sun and his colleagues reviewed the findings of 12 published studies as well as data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The studies included nearly 800000 men and women. The study populations were from the United States the United Kingdom and Scandinavian countries. The studies covered 1971 to 2010. Over the study periods there were almost 98000 deaths recorded. The study couldn't show a direct cause-and-effect relationship. But the review suggests that the risk of dying prematurely from heart disease and stroke dropped approximately 25 percent when people had three servings of whole grains (48 grams total) daily compared to those who ate fewer or no servings of whole grains. The risk of death from cancer appeared to decrease about 15 percent the study authors said. Sun said many possibilities can help explain why whole-grain consumption seemed to affect death risk. Whole grains are high in fiber so they can help regulate blood sugar and improve blood cholesterol levels which can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Fiber also makes you feel full longer so you may eat fewer calories maintain a healthy weight and lower heart disease risk he added.|
Thu Apr 28 11:42:45 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/U0DoZsSLhT, | Critics Call on FDA to Ban Concentrated Caffeine|, |['caffeine' 'caffeine powder' 'concentrated caffeine' 'caffeine overdose' 'pure caffeine' 'liquid' 'inhaler' 'FDA' 'food and drug administration'] |, |April 27 2016 -- Concentrated caffeine products are a major public health hazard and should be banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration critics say. After two young men Logan Stiner and Wade Sweatt died from caffeine overdoses in 2014 the FDA started warning consumers about the products ABC News reported. But lawmakers and advocates want the FDA to ban concentrated caffeine which can be bought online as a powder liquid or even an inhaler. The products are often marketed as health supplements with little or no warning about potency. One teaspoon of powdered pure caffeine is the equivalent of 25 cups of coffee according toABC News. On Tuesday the FDA said it has received no reports of adverse events associated with concentrated caffeine since it sent warning letters in August 2015 to five companies that produced the products. Lawmakers say they're upset that the FDA has not taken more action on the issue and fear that it will take more deaths for the agency to completely ban the products ABC Newsreported. "It's like an explosive a catastrophe waiting to happen" Sen Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. told reporters Tuesday. One of the groups calling for a ban on concentrated caffeine products is the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CPSI). "It is astonishing that a substance that is fatal for adults in the amount of two tablespoons is sold cheaply over the Internet as loose powder in large bags without clear warnings" Laura MacCleery the group's regulatory affairs director said in a statement. While the five companies targeted by the FDA stopped making the products that did not solve the problem. "After only a quick Google search we were able to order a small bottle of liquid caffeine from South Korea that contains an astonishing 9000 milligrams of caffeine -- enough to kill nearly seven people -- and yet the label says only to use it 'sparingly' " MacCleery said. "We easily purchased large bags of pure powder sufficient to kill several dozen people and a gallon jug of what looks like water but is actually a highly caffeinated liquid -- a cup of which would be a fatal dose" she added. "A ban on such products would allow enforcement action against any company selling it -- not just the five that received a warning letter" MacCleery explained. "It would mean that such products could be seized by Customs at the border. It would also send a far clearer signal to the public about the risks. Any action less than a ban would be confirmation that FDA has lost its way" she concluded.|

The study included about 1100 men with early-stage prostate cancer that had not spread beyond the gland. Half received the traditional radiation therapy program of 41 treatments over eight weeks while the others received slightly higher doses during 28 treatments over about 5.5 weeks. After five years cancer-free survival rates were just over 85 percent for those in the traditional group and just over 86 percent for those in the shorter treatment group while overall survival rates were 93.2 percent and 92.5 percent respectively. "This study has implications for public policy" said lead investigator Dr. W. Robert Lee. He is a professor at the Duke Cancer Institute's department of radiation oncology in Durham N.C. "Because the shorter regimen has advantages such as greater patient convenience and lower costs it's important to establishing whether we can cure as many patients with the shorter regimen. Our study provides that information for the first time" he added in a university news release. "An estimated 220000 men are expected to be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States and the majority will have early-stage disease at low risk for recurrence" Lee said. The study published April 4 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology was partly funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.|

Overall the birth rate for teens aged 15 to 19 declined 41 percent between 2006 and 2014 -- dropping from 41.1 live births per 1000 females down to 24.2 according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The greatest declines occurred for Hispanic teens and black teens where the rates fell by 51 percent and 44 percent respectively the CDC said. The birth rate for white teens declined by 35 percent. "That's really helped reduce the gap between minority teens and white teens in this country when it comes to teen birth rates" said report co-author Shanna Cox. She is associate director for science in the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health. Any decline in teen birth rates is good news for American society said Dr. Jennifer Wu an obstetrician-gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. "Teenage pregnancies have a higher rate of poor outcomes" Wu said. "Often these pregnancies are unintended and the mothers face various socioeconomic disadvantages. Teenagers often do not access good prenatal care and this can have a huge impact on the pregnancies." Cox said a "one-two punch" is responsible for the continued decline in teen birth rates. The first "punch" is the promotion and use of effective birth control particularly the increased use of long-acting reversible contraceptives including IUDs and implants she said.  IUD and implant use increased from less than 1 percent of teens in 2005 to 7 percent in 2013 according to the CDC. "These devices have a very very low rate of failure and they only have to be inserted once" Cox explained.

"Previous studies have reported improvement in pain and function [after weight-loss surgery]" said study author Wendy King an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. However most of those studies only followed people for a year after their procedure she added. "We found through three years of follow-up that depending on the measure 50 to 75 percent of adults with severe obesity who had bariatric [weight-loss] surgery experienced clinically significant improvements in pain physical functioning and walking time" she said. "Our findings reinforce the findings of shorter-term studies." King's team evaluated more than 2200 men and women who had weight-loss surgery at one of 10 hospitals across the United States. The patients' median age was 47 and their median body mass index (BMI) was more than 45 which is considered severely obese. Most had the operation known as gastric bypass which reduces the size of the stomach. At the start of the study 44 percent could not walk a quarter mile in seven minutes a commonly used measure for assessing mobility King said. After three years only 26 percent could not she added. And about three-fourths of those with severe hip or knee pain or disability had improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis by the third year the study found. More improvement was seen in men those who were younger those who had higher incomes and those who had lower BMIs. Patients with fewer depression symptoms less leg swelling and no diabetes at the study's start also saw greater gains in mobility. At the three-year mark the patients weighed on average 28 percent less than they did before their surgery the researchers found. The findings were published April 5 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Why was there such an impact on pain and function? "Excess weight-bearing leads to joint damage and that leads to pain and that leads to restriction in activity" King explained.|

Between 2000 and 2014 there was a 12 percent overall drop in deaths from the progressive lung disease according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Report co-author Hanyu Ni said the figures aren't unexpected noting that "the declines in the COPD-related mortality are consistent with declines in the prevalence of current smoking for men and women in the United States." But Ni added the study only quantified death rate trends and didn't look at the reasons behind those trends. Ni is an associate director for science with the CDC's division of vital statistics at the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. Dr. David Mannino who's with the University of Kentucky's College of Public Health agreed that the study "results are not surprising." He too cited the nationwide decline in smoking the number one cause of COPD. "Smoking is the biggest factor driving COPD deaths in the U.S." said Mannino a professor of medicine in the division of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a progressive disease of the airways that makes it difficult to breathe. COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It's the third biggest killer in the United States and most people with COPD are current or past smokers according to the U.S. National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. For the study Ni's team reviewed data collected by the National Vital Statistics System between 2000 and 2014. The report painted a mixed picture of risk. For example while men saw their COPD fatality rate drop by nearly 23 percent women saw their rate fall by just 4 percent. Age also played a role. Men between the ages of 65 and 84 saw their death rate drop by nearly 30 percent while those 85 and older saw their rate dip by 23 percent. But for men between 45 and 64 the death rate rose by nearly 13 percent.|

Testing for inherited abnormalities in DNA repair genes could provide patients and family members important information about their health and cancer risk the study authors said. "With the exception of some cancer syndromes in children prostate cancer is the most heritable of human malignancies" said the study's co-lead author Dr. Michael Walsh. He is a geneticist and pediatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center in New York City. "Historically the main benefit of identifying cancer-causing mutations has been prevention and early detection in families. Now we can use inherited genomic information to target treatment with specific therapies shown to be effective in those with specific genomic subsets of prostate cancer" Walsh said in a cancer center news release. The research team found a link between advanced prostate cancer and mutations in DNA repair genes.  The mutations occur far more often in men with advanced disease than in those with prostate cancer that hasn't spread the study authors said. In addition men with the abnormal repair genes are more likely to have close relatives with cancers other than prostate cancer compared to men without the mutations. These findings could help identify families that are at high risk for cancer and help prevent it in future generations the researchers said. The findings are of interest for two reasons study co-senior author Dr. Kenneth Offit said in the news release. Offit is chief of clinical genetics and head of the Niehaus Center for Inherited Cancer Genomics at Memorial Sloan Kettering. "First these findings potentially change clinical practice because we now show that testing for these DNA repair genes should be offered to all men with advanced prostate cancer" he said. "The second important finding is that we see clusters of cancers other than prostate breast ovarian and pancreatic in these families that were not expected and that will stimulate further research." More study is needed to determine whether abnormal DNA repair genes could help predict disease outcomes the scientists said. The study team consisted of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston the University of Washington School of Medicine the University of Michigan and the Institute of Cancer Research London. The findings were published online July 6 in the New England Journal of Medicine.|

According to The New York Times an unidentified health official with knowledge of the situation said Thursday that officials were mulling such an advisory. Until now local transmission of mosquito-borne Zika -- which can cause devastating birth defects in babies -- has been restricted to a neighborhood in north Miami known as Wynwood. Florida health officials report there have been at least 28 local Zika infections in that locale and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that pregnant women not travel to the area. A broader travel advisory for pregnant women could threaten tourism and heighten fears for pregnant women living in the Miami area. The Wynwood area remains the only spot in the continental United States known to have locally transmitted cases of Zika. The first such cases were reported there July 29 in four people. But on Thursday the Times' source told the newspaper that "a handful of cases" of possible local transmission involving people in "close proximity to each other" occurred in Miami Beach a prime tourist spot. The health official said that more details -- including any travel advisory for pregnant women -- would not be announced officially until Friday at the earliest the Times said. "Now that we have a second area of local transmission I think officials wouldn't be surprised to see in the coming weeks another area" the official added. "So in an effort to simplify things and get ahead there are discussions about expanding the area to possibly include the county or other parts of the Miami area." Jackie Schutz communications director for Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Thursday that public health officials "have not confirmed a new zone of active transmission" outside of Wynwood but "there are multiple cases being investigated." And Philip Levine the mayor of Miami Beach also told the Times that no confirmed cases had yet been reported in the city. But "there could be a link to Miami Beach" he said "We can expect to see Zika popping up here and there but it's not an epidemic."|

"Adults benefit from any amount of physical activity" said study co-author Janet Fulton. "Helping inactive people become more physically active is an important step towards healthier and more vibrant communities." Fulton is chief of the Physical Activity and Health Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the study the researchers analyzed results of a 2014 national survey about health focusing on people aged 50 and older. The investigators defined inactivity as moving around only to accomplish routine daily duties. Based on that definition 31 million older Americans are inactive -- just over 29 percent of women and nearly 26 percent of men. One-third of Hispanics and blacks were inactive the findings showed. That compared with 26 percent of whites and 27 percent of people in other racial and ethnic groups. The older Americans get the less exercise they get according to the study. Thirty-five percent of people aged 75 and older were inactive as were 27 percent of those between 65 and 74 and 25 percent of those aged 50 to 64. Southerners were least likely to exercise: 30 percent were inactive. In comparison 28 percent of older people in the Midwest 27 percent in the Northeast and 23 percent in the West were inactive. Colorado had the most active older Americans with 82 percent getting daily exercise. People in Arkansas were the least active with only 61 percent getting daily exercise according to the report. People carrying extra pounds were less likely to be active while those with more education were more apt to exercise the study found. And not surprisingly people with a chronic disease were more inactive (32 percent) than those who were not ill (19 percent). Physical activity can boost life span and lower the risk of conditions such as heart disease type 2 diabetes dementia and some kinds of cancer according to the CDC. And among older people exercise also can reduce the risk of falls and broken bones. "More work is needed to make it safer and easier for people of all ages and abilities to be physically active in their communities" lead author Kathleen Watson said in a CDC news release. Watson is an epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Nutrition Physical Activity and Obesity. The report was published in the Sept. 15 issue of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.|

"We were able to conclude that at least 30 percent of the antibiotics that are given in doctors' offices emergency departments and hospital-based clinics are unnecessary meaning that no antibiotics were needed at all" said lead researcher Dr. Katherine Fleming-Dutra. Such misuse has helped fuel the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which infect 2 million Americans and kill 23000 every year said Fleming-Dutra a pediatrician and epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antibiotics are most misused in the treatment of short-term respiratory conditions such as colds bronchitis sore throats and sinus and ear infections the researchers reported. "About half of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions were unnecessary" Fleming-Dutra said. In this study Fleming-Dutra and her colleagues analyzed more than 184000 outpatient visits reported in a 2010-2011 national medical care survey. Of those sampled visits nearly 13 percent resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. About 262 million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed in 2011 in the United States but until now no one knew how many of those prescriptions were inappropriate she said. To assess misuse of antibiotics the researchers relied on national treatment guidelines to look for conditions that should never be treated using antibiotics such as the common cold sore throats caused by viral infections and bronchitis. "Nobody should be giving antibiotics for the common cold" Fleming-Dutra said. "It gets better without antibiotics." The investigators also included bacterial infections that can clear up on their own without the help of antibiotics such as sinus and ear infections. In those cases the researchers relied on regions that already are exercising good antibiotic control as a national benchmark for how often antibiotics should be used to treat these conditions. Collectively acute respiratory conditions led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions annually for every 1000 people but only 111 prescriptions were deemed appropriate for these conditions the study authors said.|

Gonorrhea samples taken last spring from seven patients in Honolulu showed resistance to azithromycin at dramatically higher levels than typically seen in the United States the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported at its STD Prevention Conference in Atlanta. Five of the samples also showed increased resistance to ceftriaxone the antibiotic given alongside azithromycin in the dual regimen recommended by the CDC. This is the first cluster of cases to show increased resistance to both azithromycin and ceftriaxone said Dr. Jonathan Mermin director of CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD and TB Prevention. Data published by the CDC earlier this year showed evidence of emerging azithromycin resistance in gonorrhea samples found across the nation but those infections were still susceptible to ceftriaxone. "Our last line of defense against gonorrhea is weakening" Mermin said in a statement. "If resistance continues to increase and spread current treatment will ultimately fail and 800000 Americans a year will be at risk for untreatable gonorrhea." The news isn't all bleak however. At the same conference researchers from Louisiana State University reported on an experimental oral antibiotic currently being tested that could offer a new option for treating gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that spreads through unprotected vaginal anal and oral sex. More than 350000 new cases were reported in the United States in 2014 according to the CDC. But the agency believes that the exact number is much higher. Young people especially those under 24 appear to be most at risk of gonorrhea the CDC said. Gonorrhea can cause burning and painful urination in men along with yellow or green discharge from the penis and swollen or painful testicles according to the CDC. Most women with gonorrhea either have mild symptoms or none at all and the disease is frequently mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection the CDC said.|

An analysis of 2007-08 federal government survey results found that about 91 percent of youngsters did not have healthy diets. Those between the ages of 2 and 19 get most of their calories from simple carbohydrates such as sugary drinks and desserts. "A primary reason for so few children having ideal cardiovascular health is poor nutrition" statement author Dr. Julia Steinberger said in an association news release. "Children are eating high-calorie low-nutrition foods and not eating enough healthy foods such as fruits vegetables whole-grains fish and other foods strongly associated with good heart health and a healthy body weight."  Lack of physical activity is another concern. Among 6- to 11-year-olds half of boys and about a third of girls got the recommended 60 minutes or more a day of exercise. Between 16 and 19 years of age those percentages plummeted to 10 percent of boys and 5 percent of girls. Not surprisingly kids have packed on the pounds. About 10 percent of 2- to 5-year-olds were obese compared to between 19 percent and 27 percent of 12- to 19-year olds. About a third of the older kids had tried a cigarette. Nearly all the children had ideal blood pressure. And most had ideal cholesterol and blood sugar levels though not as good as blood pressure levels according to the statement published Aug. 11 in the journal Circulation. Overall the findings show that instead "of taking a wait-and-see approach by treating disease later in adulthood we should help children maintain the standards of ideal cardiovascular health that most children are born with" said Steinberger director of pediatric cardiology at the University of Minnesota. "It's much harder to turn back the clock" she added.|

Harvard researchers found that women who went to religious services at least twice a week were one-third less likely to die over the 20-year study period compared to women who never attended services. Is this a case of divine intervention or is there another reason behind the improved longevity? "The association between religious participation and mortality probably has more to do with religious practice and specifically communal practice like attending religious services than with religious belief" said study author Tyler VanderWeele. "Something about the communal religious experience seems to be powerful for health" said VanderWeele a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. VanderWeele said previous research has found that personal religious or spiritual identity or private religious practices don't seem to matter as much for health. "These things may of course still be important and meaningful within the context of religious life but they do not appear to affect health as strongly. The results from our study suggest that there may be something important about religious service attendance beyond solitary spirituality" he said. Does that mean that folks who don't attend regularly attend religious services are doomed to a shorter life span? Not necessarily. VanderWeele pointed out that "with data of this sort one generally cannot definitively demonstrate a cause-effect relationship."  He added that the association doesn't seem to be as strong for men as it is for women. Nevertheless VanderWeele said research does seem to indicate that women who regularly attend religious services appear to benefit from a boost in social support and a heightened sense of self-discipline along with a diminished risk for both smoking and depression. "[So] at least for those already religious service attendance may be a powerful and underappreciated health resource" VanderWeele added. The study was published in the May 16 issue of JAMA Internal Medicine. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that religion is an important part of their lives. Eighty-three percent said they've prayed to God during the past week. More than four in 10 Americans said they attended a religious service in the past week the researchers noted.|

"Increasingly we are seeing the impact of an aging population -- fueled by maturing baby boomers -- on major diseases including cancer" said lead researcher Shirley Bluethmann a cancer prevention fellow at the U.S. National Cancer Institute. In 2016 nearly 62 percent of almost 16 million cancer survivors are aged 65 or older the researchers said. By 2040 an estimated 73 percent of 26 million cancer survivors will be 65 or older. "This steady and dramatic growth will affect the health care system and so is sometimes referred to as the 'silver tsunami' " Bluethmann said. "It not only has implications for older people who are at higher risk for cancer it also means that we will have higher numbers of older patients with complex health needs." In the face of this challenge health care providers will have to build collaborative care teams -- including doctors nurses and other caregivers -- to be able to respond to the needs of this vulnerable population Bluethmann noted. "We also need to emphasize the benefits of lifestyle for cancer prevention and control across the life course" she added. "Lifestyle choices including doing regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight may prevent some kinds of cancer but also offer many benefits in preserving function reducing symptoms and promoting a high quality of life into old age" Bluethmann said. For the study Bluethmann and her colleagues used federal health data from 1975 to 2012. With Census data they projected the incidence of cancer from 2016 to 2040. In addition the researchers used Medicare claims to estimate the impact of other chronic conditions such as heart disease lung disease and diabetes. They found that by 2040 cancer survivors aged 65 to 74 will make up 24 percent of all survivors those aged 75 to 84 will make up 31 percent of all survivors and those aged 85 and older will represent 18 percent.|

Tue Jun 28 14:29:06 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/oCvHXGAwdJ, | Flint's Lead Crisis 'Entirely Preventable'|, |['lead in water' 'Flint' 'Michigan' 'lead poisoning' 'lead testing' 'EPA'] |, |FRIDAY June 24 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Analysis of blood samples from young children of Flint Mich. shows they had much more lead in their blood when the city used local drinking water in an effort to cut costs a new U.S. government study reveals.  A series of blood samples showed kids younger than 6 were nearly 50 percent more likely to have elevated blood lead levels when the city used the Flint River for drinking water instead of the Detroit water system researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded.  The percentage of kids with high lead content returned to previous levels once the city switched back to the Detroit system. The reason for the lead contamination? Inappropriate corrosion control measures investigators said.  "This crisis was entirely preventable and a startling reminder of the critical need to eliminate all sources of lead from our children's environment" Patrick Breysse director of CDC's National Center for Environmental Health said in an agency news release.  Even low levels of lead in children's blood can affect intelligence ability to pay attention and academic achievement the agency noted.  The blood lead level of concern is 5 or more micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood. During the period that the Flint River water was used (April 25 2014 to Oct. 15 2015) lead levels in local tap water increased over time as did lead content in children's blood the CDC said.  The CDC has advised that all children under age 6 in Flint have their blood tested for lead by a health care provider.  According to Dr. Nicole Lurie U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response "Parents and teachers can do a lot to help children grow up healthy and strong even if they were exposed to lead."  She said the city's children are getting developmental assessments and needed services. "We have also expanded Medicaid and strongly urge parents to enroll their children and schedule appointments for them to be seen by a health provider who can follow their health as they grow and develop" Lurie said.|
Mon May 23 17:55:02 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/oeCq2WTQOU, | Surprising Foods & Drinks That Can Harm Your Teeth|, |['WebMD Magazine' 'Colleen Oakley' 'acidic food' 'tooth decay' 'enamel'] |, |Candy. Red wine. Coffee. Everyone knows those are no-nos when it comes to keeping your teeth healthy and white. But they’re not the only culprits that can wreak havoc in your mouth. Here are five surprising foods and drinks that can cause everything from stains to excess plaque to damaged teeth and gums. White wine. Don’t let its color fool you. Chardonnay pinot grigio and other white wines are highly acidic and that acid can slowly erode your teeth's hard outer shell (enamel) leaving it more prone to staining from other foods and sensitivity to pain says David Genet DMD a periodontist in Aventura FL. Don’t want to give up your nightly glass? "Pair it with cheese which can help minimize the damage caused by the acid" he says. Raisins. While dried fruits might be kinder to your waistline than candy they can be just as bad for your teeth. The reason? Fruits are full of fructose a form of sugar says Justin Sycamore DDS a dentist in Thousand Oaks CA. When fruit is dried the concentrated sugar becomes sticky adhering to your mouth and doing nearly as much tooth decay damage as candy. A great snack alternative? "Nuts" Sycamore says. "They have almost no sugar they’re full of protein and they will make you feel fuller longer." Sugar-free drinks and candy. If you think you’re doing your teeth a favor by swapping your regular soda or sports drink for diet or sugar-free think again. A recent study from the University of Melbourne in Australia found that some sugar-free drinks and candy can cause just as much tooth decay as sugar-filled ones. The reason? They have acidic additives that erode tooth enamel as much as sugar does. Potato chips. They may satisfy a salty craving but this crunchy snack can cause a lot of problems in your mouth Sycamore says. "When you chew chips they break into really small pieces that can be lodged and compacted into the grooves and crevices of the teeth" he says. Also "they’re simple carbohydrates which are broken down by the enzymes in saliva to simple sugars making them nearly as bad as candy for your teeth." Ice. Lots of people like to crunch on it and it seems like a harmless snack -- it keeps you cool and hydrated and has no calories. But chewing ice isn’t harmless Sycamore says. The habit puts a lot of stress on your teeth causing wear -- and maybe even a fracture. "A good alternative is to simply drink water" he says. If you need a chewing fix nosh on air-popped popcorn for a low-calorie snack.|
Thu Aug 25 09:11:24 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/8ibkPtieYb, | Zika May Persist for Months in Newborns: Study|, |['zika' 'zika virus' 'zika infection' 'newborns' 'babies' 'birth defects' 'microcephaly' 'late-onset microcephaly' 'mosquitoes'] |, |WEDNESDAY Aug. 24 2016 (HealthDay News) -- There's more bad news when it comes to Zika's effect on infants: A case study suggests the virus can live and cause damage in newborns for at least two months after birth. The report published online Aug. 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine involves a baby boy born in January to a woman in Sao Paulo Brazil. Zika is typically transmitted via mosquito bites but sexual transmission can also occur. The mother developed symptoms of Zika illness -- rash fever headache swollen joints -- in week 26 of her pregnancy. The doctors suspect she got the infection through sexual contact with the baby's father who had recently traveled to a Zika-endemic region. Zika is most known for its link to a devastating birth defect called microcephaly where babies are born with a smaller than normal head and underdeveloped brains. However the Sao Paulo baby appeared normal and healthy at birth with a typical head circumference according to a team led by Danielle Oliveira of the University of Sao Paulo. However closer investigation of the newborn by MRI brain scans did reveal troubling neurological abnormalities the group said. The baby also continued to show signs of Zika virus persisting in his blood urine and saliva by day 54 after birth and in his blood by day 67. A follow-up blood test by the time the baby was almost 8 months old showed no trace of Zika however. But at 6 months of age "he showed neuropsychomotor developmental delay" including muscle rigidity and spasticity the study team said. The biggest surprise was that the baby's problems "got worse over time" -- probably because the virus survived a full two months in the infant the scientists said in a university news release. The news comes a day after radiologists in Boston and Brazil published scans showing the wide range of birth defects that can occur in babies affected by the Zika virus. "From an imaging standpoint the abnormalities in the brain are very severe when compared to other congenital infections" report co-author Dr. Deborah Levine said in a news release from the journal Radiology which published the findings Aug. 23.|
Wed Apr 13 17:37:09 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/REJmdprVU7, | Brain Chip Restores Hand Movement to Quadriplegic|, |['implanted brain chip' 'movement' 'paralysis' 'paralyzed' 'movement' 'quadriplegic'] |, |WEDNESDAY April 13 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A freak diving accident at age 19 left Ian Burkhart's arms and legs paralyzed. Now 24 the former athlete has regained some use of his fingers hand and wrist thanks to an experimental technology never before tried in humans researchers report. A surgically implanted computer chip enables messages to travel from Burkhart's brain to his limbs bypassing the damaged spinal cord the researchers said. "The electronic neural bypass technology in this study demonstrates what is possible in the future and can offer hope for movement restoration to millions of people worldwide living with paralysis" said researcher Gaurav Sharma of the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus Ohio. Burkhart a high school lacrosse goalie from Dublin Ohio was injured in the ocean while on vacation at the Outer Banks in North Carolina. Now one of millions suffering from paralysis worldwide he may pave the way for revolutionary advances in their treatment the researchers said. Here's how the system works: Doctors in 2014 implanted a computer chip in an area of Burkhart's brain called the motor cortex which is responsible for controlling hand movements Sharma said. "By recording signals from the motor cortex interpreting and transmitting signals by computer directly to the paralyzed hand muscles we bypass the damaged spinal cord" he said. Mastering the technology was no easy feat. Burkhart attended up to three sessions a week for 15 months after the chip was implanted. The system enabled him to make isolated finger movements and six different wrist and hand motions allowing him to grasp manipulate and release objects Sharma said. The young man was able to use the system to complete everyday tasks most people take for granted -- such as grasping a bottle pouring its contents into a jar and using a stick to stir the contents of the jar Sharma explained. The technology is still in its early stage but the researchers hope it might one day help quadriplegics use their limbs. "It is conceivable that this technology could be used to link brain activity to stimulate leg muscles to help people with lower limb paralysis" Sharma said.|

Wed Aug 17 16:34:14 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/tp3eDPxMyD, | Acetaminophen and Pregnancy: Bad Mix?|, |['painkiller use in pregnancy' 'painkillers & behavior problems' 'safe drugs during pregnancy' 'is Tylenol OK during pregnancy' 'acetaminophen in pregnancy' 'drugs not to take when pregnant'] |, |Aug 17 2016 -- Another report that links taking acetaminophen while pregnant with behavior problems in children may leave some pregnant women wondering whether they should use the pain reliever. The study published this week adds to a list of reports that associate the medication with children’s ADHD autism symptoms delayed language skills and asthma. Acetaminophen is the main ingredient in Tylenol and many other pain medicines. It's often one of the only pain relievers doctors recommend to pregnant women for pain or fever. It’s long been viewed as safe during pregnancy and is used by a large number of pregnant women in the U.S. and abroad. Experts are divided on the strength of the studies linking the medication to behavioral problems. None of them proved that the medications caused any of the health problems -- they only showed an association. And untreated pain or fever in pregnancy can also carry risks to an unborn child. Hal C. Lawrence MD the CEO and executive vice president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says the studies “show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and developmental issues in children." But researcher John Thompson PhD associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Auckland says "evidence appears to be building” linking acetaminophen and behavior problems. In a 2014 study of 871 children Thompson linked acetaminophen to ADHD symptoms in children ages 7 and 11. Thompson says more study is still needed but “the results are consistent.” Here’s what some of the studies showed. In the most recent study researchers looked at data from nearly 7800 mothers. They asked mothers about their acetaminophen use at 18 and 32 weeks during their pregnancies and again when their children were 5 years old. Each time they were asked if they’d used the pain reliever in the past 3 months. At 18 weeks more than half the mothers reported using acetaminophen; about 40% reported its use by week 32. Overall the children whose mothers took acetaminophen during pregnancy were about 1.4 times more likely to have behavioral problems and 1.3 times more likely to be hyperactive.|

One skin condition where the finding could potentially lead to a treatment is vitiligo. Vitiligo is caused by the loss of skin pigmentation and causes blotchy white patches on the skin. The findings could also lead to new treatments for gray hair and skin discoloration around scars said the researchers led by senior investigator Mayumi Ito. She is an associate professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. The researchers identified the two cellular signals through experiments with mice and human cells. This is thought to be the first evidence linking the molecular signals to the routine growth of cells that produce pigment (melanocytes) and provide color to skin and hair the investigators said in a medical center news release. The study was published online April 28 in the journal Cell Reports. Vitiligo affects about 1 percent of people worldwide according to the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.|

Now new research suggests that at least one class of chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines is not related to the debilitating condition. Anthracyclines include medications such as doxorubicin and epirubicin among others. One expert not connected to the study said the findings should be reassuring for patients. Used in combination with other drugs anthracyclines "have a long track record in the treatment of breast cancer and still are the preferred regimens especially in younger fit women with aggressive breast cancer such as triple-negative cancer" explained Dr. Nina D'Abreo. She is an oncologist at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola N.Y. "It is encouraging to know that women who are felt to be most likely to benefit from these regimens have one less side effect to consider" she said. In the study researchers led by Dr. Patricia Ganz of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles assessed certain mental skills -- memory processing speed and executive function -- in breast cancer survivors. Investigators checked in with the women at three months six months one year and an average of 4.8 years after the survivors had finished their primary treatment. According to Ganz's team the women's mental skills were similar whether or not they had received anthracycline as part of their chemotherapy. This remained true for up to seven years after treatment the findings showed. The findings contradict previous study results the researchers said. "In this study we could not find evidence to support the claim that anthracycline treatment confers greater risk of cognitive [mental] decline for breast cancer survivors" Ganz and colleagues wrote. Dr. Stephanie Bernik is chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She called the study "well-formulated" but said the fact that its findings contradict those of prior studies is puzzling. "It is obvious that more study needs to be carried out to investigate whether or not chemotherapy has long-term cognitive consequences" she said. The report was published online April 21 in the journal JAMA Oncology.|
Tue Jul 05 14:26:44 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/WLUw6rqBsy, | Is U.S. Government Subsidizing Fattening Foods?|, |['grains' 'dairy' 'meat' 'subsidy' 'government' 'health issues'] |, |TUESDAY July 5 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Americans get more than half of their daily calories from seven farm foods that are subsidized by the U.S. government but a new study suggests those subsidies may be contributing to the obesity epidemic. The problem according to the researchers: The biggest consumers of such food products are also much more likely to be obese and to struggle with high cholesterol high inflammation levels or high blood sugar. The foods include grains dairy and livestock products. "We know that eating too many of these foods can lead to obesity cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. However we still didn't expect to see such strong results when looking directly at the association between the consumption of subsidized foods and health" said Edward Gregg. He is chief of the epidemiology and statistics branch in the division of diabetes translation with the U.S. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Gregg was not a part of the study. But a team led by his colleague Karen Siegel reported the findings in the July 5 online edition of JAMA Internal Medicine. The researchers focused on seven leading commodities covered in the 1973 U.S. Farm Bill. Under that law producers receive direct financial support from the federal government to grow or raise farm products that include corn soybeans wheat rice sorghum dairy and livestock. The goal is to ensure "a plentiful supply of food at reasonable prices" given that domestic food production accounts for 80 percent of the food that Americans eat Gregg explained. The researchers noted that such subsidies amounted to $170 billion between 1995 and 2010. Unfortunately much of this food ends up being processed into nutritionally questionable products including high-calorie sugary sodas and juices (sweetened with corn syrup) high-calorie packaged foods high-fat meats and high-fat dairy products the study authors said. In contrast fruits and vegetables have historically been excluded from such subsidies given their "perishable nature and shorter shelf-life" Gregg said. To see how this might affect the American diet the research team analyzed food information collected between 2001 and 2006 by the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.|

Fri Aug 05 13:16:02 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/AqPAHrfs7y, | Better Detection Key to Rising ALS Cases in U.S.|, |['ALS' 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis' "Lou Gehrig's disease" 'ALS diagnosis' 'ALS detection' 'CDC' 'centers for disease control and prevention' 'ALS rates'] |, |THURSDAY Aug. 4 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Better detection appears to explain the recent rise in the number of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases in the United States government health officials say.  It's unlikely that the rate of ALS -- also known as Lou Gehrig's disease named after the legendary baseball player who died from it -- is actually increasing says a new report from the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.  According to the agency's National ALS Registry the estimated ALS prevalence rate rose from 4.7 cases per 100000 people in 2012 to 5 cases per 100000 in 2013.  However "it is likely the increased prevalence rate since the first report was issued does not reflect an actual increase in the number of ALS cases" said report lead author Dr. Paul Mehta medical epidemiologist and principal investigator with the ALS Registry. "Rather this increase is more attributable to better detection methods used to identify ALS cases along with an increased public awareness of the registry."  The registry estimates the national prevalence for ALS using data from Medicare Medicaid and the Veterans Health and Benefits Administrations. It reported 14713 identified cases in 2012 and 15908 identified cases in 2013. ALS was more common among whites males and people ages 60 to 69. Those with the lowest number of ALS cases were people ages 18 to 39 and those 80 and older the researchers found. ALS a progressive neurodegenerative disease affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Eventually the brain loses the ability to control muscle movement. There is no cure.  In 2014 the disease gained much attention during a blockbuster fundraiser known as the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge which went viral on social media and raised money and awareness.  The new study's findings are similar to those of long-established ALS registries in Europe and previous smaller-scale epidemiologic studies in the United States the researchers said. The study was published Aug. 4 in the Weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|

At the time Bardack said Clinton 68 was overheated and dehydrated; later it was revealed that Clinton had been diagnosed with pneumonia days earlier. Clinton's current medications include: Bardack diagnosed the pneumonia after a scan of the lungs that also included scanning to assess heart disease risk producing a ''coronary calcium score.'' It evaluates the amount of calcium in coronary arteries an indication of heart disease risk. Clinton’s calcium score was zero as it has been in the past. Bardack concludes that Clinton is “in excellent mental condition” and that she is ''healthy and fit to serve as president of the United States."|

The researchers said these disruptions occur in areas of the brain involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness as well as cognitive function. The researchers explained that white matter tracts are bundles made up of long fibers of nerve cells that connect one part of the brain to another. "If white matter tracts are impaired communication between brain regions is disrupted" said researcher Shumei Li. She's from the department of Medical Imaging at Guangdong No. 2 Provincial People's Hospital Guangzhou China. Although the study found an association between white tract matter abnormalities and insomnia it wasn't designed to prove cause-and-effect. People with primary insomnia have ongoing trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. This nightly tossing and turning isn't related to another medical condition or known cause according to the researchers. It can lead to daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairment. Some people with primary insomnia also suffer from depression and anxiety disorders the researchers said. Up to 5 percent of adults have this sleep disorder but it's unclear exactly why they can't sleep and how the condition affects their brain the researchers noted. "Insomnia is a remarkably prevalent disorder" said Li. "However its causes and consequences remain elusive." For the study the researchers recruited 23 patients with primary insomnia and 30 healthy volunteers. All of the participants completed surveys that enabled study authors to evaluate their mental status and sleep patterns. Using an advanced MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) the researchers also looked at the pattern of water movement in white matter to identify any irregularities. They found that participants with insomnia had significantly reduced white matter "integrity" in several regions of the brain. One area was the thalamus which regulates consciousness sleep and alertness. Another was the corpus callosum the area that bridges the two halves of the brain the study authors said.|

Tue Apr 19 15:31:58 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/py9mrEw9hf, | Two-Step Ebola Vaccine Works in Early Trial|, |['Ebola' 'ebola outbreak' 'ebola virus' 'ebola vaccine' 'two-shot ebola vaccine' 'preventing ebola'] |, |TUESDAY April 19 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A new two-step Ebola vaccine strategy has shown some promise in early clinical trials. The trials involved two candidate Ebola vaccines that were given to volunteers in separate shots the researchers said. One vaccine was provided first as a "primer" shot and the second was given as a "booster." The winning combo was a "primer" shot of a genetically engineered cold virus (AD-26) followed by a "booster" shot of a similarly altered smallpox virus (MVA) according to the report. In both cases the viruses had been altered to include genetic material from Ebola so any immune response to the vaccine could theoretically promote immunity to Ebola the study authors explained. An immune response was observed after primary immunization with the AD-26 vaccine and boosting with the MVA resulted in sustained elevation of specific immunity to Ebola the researchers found. Further neither vaccine caused any serious adverse events in the 87 people aged 18 to 50 who volunteered for the phase 1 clinical trial. The findings were published April 19 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The recent West African outbreak of Ebola the largest in history killed more than 11000 people and infected more than 28000 according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ebola expert Dr. Lee Norman chief medical officer for the University of Kansas Hospital said it's good that researchers are investigating different ways of delivering vaccines for the deadly virus. "The delivery method if it is successful is really an important building block for a successful vaccine" Norman said. "We have to remind ourselves that phase 1 trials are typically more about safety than about effectiveness. It isn't typically the goal of a phase 1 trial to emphasize effectiveness." Dr. Amesh Adalja a senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security in Baltimore agreed. "Since the West African Ebola outbreak many different vaccine approaches have flourished and with several promising candidate vaccines the manner in which future Ebola outbreaks will be managed will be dramatically improved" Adalja said.|

Tablets and other electronic gizmos can provide a child with learning and entertainment but what works when it's time to sign off? A new study into the issue holds some surprises including the fact that giving a preschooler a "two minute" warning for media downtime may backfire. Even though the study found almost four in every five parents used the technique only 20 percent of them said it actually helped. The "'two more minutes' warning can both set expectations and remind a child that he or she is not the one in control" said study lead author Alexis Hiniker. That "can lead to a power struggle" she said. "So if that is something that a family is struggling with I might recommend experimenting with ways of setting expectations that give the child a little bit more of a voice or a sense of agency." Hiniker is a doctoral candidate in the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. She and her colleagues are slated to present the findings this week at a meeting of the Association for Computing Machinery in San Jose Calif.  In the study Hiniker's group interviewed 27 sets of parents and 28 families also kept a "screen time diary" for two weeks. One finding ran counter to what many may believe: In most cases parents were not deemed to be using a tablet or other device as a kind of electronic "babysitter" the research team found. In fact nearly all the parents expressed a "general negative impression" of screen media for kids and felt exposure should be carefully monitored and limited. It was often tough to get a child to stop using devices on their own however and most said they -- not their child -- put an end to sessions. The most common reason for doing so was because of a change in situation such as an impending play date.|
Fri Apr 29 12:59:52 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/XD9TubdBrj, | Kids of Older Moms May Have a Leg Up on Peers|, |['older moms' 'older mothers' 'children' 'kids' 'height' 'education' 'younger mothers' 'kids of older moms'] |, |FRIDAY April 29 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Although older women may face more potential pregnancy complications their children seem to fare better in some ways over the long run a new study suggests. Using data on over 1.5 million Swedish adults researchers found that people born to mothers who were in their late-30s or 40s tended to be taller fitter and more educated than those born to younger moms. But that doesn't guarantee that being born to an older mother means a person will be fitter taller or more likely to aspire to a higher education. This study can only show an association between those factors. People are choosing to give birth at later ages the study authors said. For example in Germany and the United Kingdom the average age at first birth is 30 years old. And in Sweden in 2013 more than one-quarter of babies were born to women 35 and older the report noted. A woman who gives birth in her 40s rather than her 20s faces higher risks of pregnancy complications and problems for her baby -- including Down syndrome and autism according to background information in the study. But her child is also born 20 years later in time said researcher Mikko Myrskyla director of the laboratory for population research at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock Germany. "Over a period of 20 years most developed countries have seen strong expansion of education improvements in health and increases in height" Myrskyla explained. The potential disadvantages of being born to an older mom he said may be more than offset by the advantages of being born in a later time period. The study results are based on data from Swedish adults born between 1960 and 1991. In general the investigators found people who'd been born to older mothers tended to have higher grades in high school and were more likely to go to college versus those born to moms younger than 30. But the pattern seemed to be entirely explained by the time period in which a person was born according to Myrskyla.|

Researchers reviewed the findings of eight clinical trials worldwide as well as other evidence and concluded that the supplements appear to help battle depression in people already on medication. "Omega-3 fish oil -- in combination with antidepressants -- had a statistically significant effect over a placebo" said study leader Jerome Sarris. He is head of the ARCADIA Mental Health Research Group at the University of Melbourne in Australia.  The study looked at the result of trials where patients battling depression took either a standard antidepressant plus a form of omega-3 fish oil versus the antidepressant plus an inactive placebo. "The difference for patients taking both antidepressants and omega-3 compared to a placebo was highly significant" Sarris said in a university news release. "This is an exciting finding because here we have a safe evidence-based approach that could be considered a mainstream treatment" he explained. "Many studies have shown omega-3s are very good for general brain health and improving mood but this is the first analysis of studies that looks at using them in combination with antidepressant medication" Sarris said. Doctors may be reluctant to prescribe dietary supplements in combination with antidepressants due to a lack of scientific evidence and concerns about safety. But Sarris noted the researchers found no major safety concerns in combining the two therapies. However the study authors stressed that patients should always talk with their health care provider before taking dietary supplements. In addition people need to be aware that these supplements can differ in quality. "We're not telling people to rush out and buy buckets of supplements. Always speak to your medical professional before changing or initiating a treatment" Sarris said. One expert in the United States believes the findings might be of use to patients. "The general population is often looking for natural remedies to treat health problems" said Dr. Victor Fornari. "A large number of individuals with depression do not reach remission with one or two trials of medication" added Fornari. He directs child and adolescent psychiatry at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park N.Y. "This may enhance the recovery of individuals who do not respond to antidepressants alone" he said. However Fornari agreed with the authors that "individuals are cautioned to consult with their medical professional before proceeding." The study was published April 26 in the American Journal of Psychiatry.|

What's more older men who say they enjoy frequent sex also appear to face a higher risk for such serious cardiovascular events the study authors said. "The result for men is indeed surprising for us given our general assumption that sex is always good for health" said study lead author Hui Liu an associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University. Liu pointed to several potential explanations. "When men get older they may have more difficulties reaching an orgasm for medical or emotional reasons" she noted perhaps leading to overexertion exhaustion and cardiovascular stress. Also medication and supplements to improve sexual function "may have negative effects on their cardiovascular health" Liu added. "Moreover having quite a high frequency of sex may indicate problems of sexual addiction sexual compulsivity or sexual impulsivity" she said. These may be related to the onset of anxiety and/or depression which can negatively affect the heart Liu said. But at least one cardiologist said he was reluctant to accept the study findings until more research is carried out. The study researchers evaluated survey responses from more than 2200 seniors who participated in the U.S. National Social Life Health and Aging Project. Participants answered sexual behavior questionnaires in 2005-2006 and again five years later. All were 57 to 85 years old at the time of the first survey. Among the findings: Older men were more likely than older women to say they were sexually active. In the two surveys about 70 percent and 50 percent of men respectively said they had had sex in the past year compared with roughly 40 percent and 23 percent of women.|
Thu Jun 30 15:26:11 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/EwjctfA6XQ, | FDA Asks How Safe Is That Hand Sanitizer?|, |['hand sanitizer' 'cold prevention' 'flu prevention' 'triclosan' 'FDA'] |, |WEDNESDAY June 29 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Millions of Americans use hand sanitizers every day believing they safely kill bacteria. Now the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants to find out if that's really true. The agency Wednesday requested makers of antibacterial hand sanitizers and related products to provide data showing the products' active ingredients actually reduce bacteria and are harmless over time. Of particular concern are the long-term effects of these sanitizers on pregnant women and children the agency said.  "These products provide a convenient alternative when hand washing with plain soap and water is unavailable but it's our responsibility to determine whether these products are safe and effective so that consumers can be confident when using them on themselves and their families multiple times a day" Dr. Janet Woodcock director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said in an agency news release. The agency wants more data on the active ingredients in hand-sanitizing products such as towelettes gels and rubs that purport to kill bacteria. Alcohol -- ethanol or ethyl alcohol -- is used in 90 percent of these hand cleaners the FDA said. Other ingredients under scrutiny are isopropyl alcohol and benzalkonium chloride the agency said. However FDA officials stressed that the move doesn't mean the agency believes these products are either ineffective or unsafe.  Officials said the request stems from new research and recommendations from an independent advisory committee of scientific and medical experts.  Recent research has found that levels of antiseptic ingredients in users' urine and blood are higher than previously thought. This raises questions regarding absorption since these antiseptics aren't washed off the agency explained.  In the meantime washing your hands with soap and running water remains one of the best ways to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading infections to others according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the absence of soap and water the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol.  "Today consumers are using antiseptic rubs more frequently at home work school and in other public settings where the risk of infection is relatively low" the FDA's Woodcock noted.|

As a result the CDC is changing its testing recommendations. They’re advising doctors to check the urine and blood of patients who’ve had symptoms of the virus for less than 14 days. Previously the agency recommended only blood tests. In a recent study done by the Florida Department of Health 66 people suspected of having Zika infections had their blood and urine tested on the same day. The virus was detected in the urine of 52 out of 55 patients (95%) who were tested within 5 days of getting their first symptoms. Blood tests meanwhile picked up the virus in only 31 out of those same 55 patients (56%). What’s more urine tests were able to pick up Zika for almost 2 weeks after symptoms first appeared while blood tests only caught the virus within the first week. Saliva was also more likely to flag the virus than blood especially in the early days of infection. All patients tested within 2 days of their first symptoms tested positive for Zika virus in their saliva while blood tests caught only about two-thirds of patients tested on the second day of symptoms. The virus is mainly mosquito-borne although some cases have been sexually transmitted. One expert says the new study suggests that sex might not be the only way the infection is passed from person to person.  “It does raise that question” says William Schaffner MD an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.  The test that picks up Zika during an active infection detects the virus by tagging a piece of its genetic code. But that test can’t tell doctors whether the virus is infectious or not when it is spotted.  “It can’t tell a live soldier from a dead one” Schaffner says. But if the virus stays alive in saliva for days after the infection it might mean that people could pass it to others through “intimacies that are not necessarily sexual” Schaffner says like coughing or kissing.|

About 2.8 million seniors are thought to have severe vision impairment -- defined as either blindness or difficulty seeing even with eyeglasses according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1.3 million of these older vision-challenged Americans fell at least once in 2014 the new CDC report said. Experts say the link between vision and balance is crucial especially as people age. Falls "represent a major source of disability and can lead to prolonged recoveries and lengthy stays in hospitals and long-term care facilities" said Dr. Robert Glatter an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said that hip and leg or arm fractures as well as wounds that are slow to heal mean falling can be disabling or even life-threatening for older people. Vision checks are key to prevention Glatter said. "Monitoring changes in visual acuity is a critical aspect of screening in older persons who live independently for fall risk -- especially if they use canes or walkers" he said. The study was led by CDC investigator John Crews and involved 2014 federal data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  Crews and colleagues found that fall risk among seniors rose significantly as vision failed. For example while about 28 percent of seniors without severe vision trouble experienced at least one fall in 2014 that number jumped to almost 47 percent in people who had such eyesight issues. Other health issues such as chronic illness gait problems leg weakness and the use of multiple medicines could push the risk of falling even higher the researchers said. And the financial cost? One 2013 study estimated the direct medical cost of falls among seniors at $34 billion annually the researchers said. Luckily simple prevention methods mean that many falls don't have to happen.|

A lung blood clot (pulmonary embolism) typically begins as a clot in the leg or pelvis that develops due to inactivity and reduced blood flow. The clot can break free and travel to a lung and lodge in a small blood vessel posing a serious threat. This new study included more than 86000 people in Japan aged 40 to 70. They were asked how many hours they spent watching television and then were followed for 19 years. During that time 59 participants died of a pulmonary embolism. Compared to those who watched less than 2.5 hours of television a day the risk of dying from pulmonary embolism increased 70 percent among those who watched 2.5 to 4.9 hours daily. It was 40 percent greater for each additional two hours of television viewing and 2.5 times higher among those who watched five or more hours a day the study found. The results were published July 25 in the journal Circulation. These findings may be of concern to Americans who reportedly watch more TV than Japanese adults said study first author Dr. Toru Shirakawa a research fellow in public health at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine. "Nowadays with online video streaming the term 'binge-watching' to describe viewing multiple episodes of television programs in one sitting has become popular" Shirakawa said in a journal news release. "This popularity may reflect a rapidly growing habit." Pulmonary embolism occurs at a lower rate in Japan than it does in Western countries but it may be on the rise said corresponding author Dr. Hiroyasu Iso a professor of public health at Osaka University. "The Japanese people are increasingly adopting sedentary lifestyles which we believe is putting them at increased risk" Iso said. While the study can't prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship it's likely the risk of death from watching too much television is even higher than what was found in the study because the condition is difficult to diagnose the researchers said.|

Curbing the kids' sugar intake improved their triglyceride levels (a type of blood fat or "lipid") as well as levels of a protein associated with heart disease known as ApoC-III researchers found. "The blood lipid responses of these children is nothing short of astounding and unrelated to calories or weight change" said study second author Dr. Robert Lustig. He is a pediatric endocrinologist at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital San Francisco.  "In order to get this degree of lipid and protein reduction by just eating less a patient would need to lose . . . one-fifth of their body weight" Lustig explained in a university news release.  The study involved 43 obese children aged 9 to 18 who had at least one chronic metabolic disorder such as high blood pressure high triglycerides or a marker for fatty liver. All of the kids were black or Hispanic. These groups are at higher risk for disorders that disrupt normal metabolism the researchers noted. For nine days the children ate and drank as they normally would with one exception: All sugary foods such as sweetened yogurt and cake were replaced with starchy items including bagels and pizza. Overall the kids' dietary sugar fell from 28 percent to just 10 percent of their total calories and fructose dropped from 12 percent to 4 percent of their total calories the findings showed. Blood tests before and after the study period found that cutting kids' sugar intake resulted in a 33 percent drop in triglycerides and a 49 percent drop in ApoC-III.   The study's first author Dr. Alejandro Gugliucci said "While statins are effective in lowering LDL ['bad' cholesterol] they only reduce heart disease risk by 50 percent. The other villain is blood lipid triglycerides and the associated protein ApoC-III."  Gugliucci a professor and associate dean for research at Touro University California College of Osteopathic Medicine added that the new study found "that just reducing sugar consumption did a wonderful job in lowering these two key risk factors by 30 to 50 percent."|

"These findings underscore the importance of good eyesight to most and that having good vision is key to one's overall sense of well-being" said lead researcher Dr. Adrienne Scott and colleagues. Scott is an assistant professor of opthalmology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. "The consistency of these findings among the varying ethnic/racial groups underscores the importance of educating the public on eye health and mobilizing public support for vision research" the researchers added in a news release. The nationwide online poll commissioned by the nonprofit health research group known as Research!America found that 88 percent of more than 2000 respondents considered good vision vital to overall health. And 47 percent said losing their sight would have the most effect on their day-to-day life. Overall respondents ranked losing vision as equal to or worse than losing hearing memory speech or a limb. The top concerns associated with vision loss were quality of life and loss of independence. Close to two-thirds of the respondents said they wear glasses. But respondents' awareness of eye diseases varied widely. Sixty-six percent were aware of cataracts; 63 percent glaucoma; 50 percent macular degeneration; and 37 percent diabetic retinopathy. One-quarter of the respondents were not aware of any eye conditions. While 76 percent and 58 percent respectively knew that too much sunlight and family history were potential risk factors for vision loss only half were aware that smoking puts eyesight at risk. The study was published online Aug. 4 in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology.|

The sweet-smelling tropical staple is rumored to slow aging help your heart and thyroid protect against illnesses like Alzheimer’s arthritis and diabetes and even help you lose weight. People are using it in everything from smoothies to bulletproof coffee a mug of java spiked with coconut oil and butter. Should you sign up for an oil change? Coconut oil is made by pressing the fat from the white “meat” inside the giant nut. About 84% of its calories come from saturated fat. To compare 14% of olive oil’s calories are from saturated fat and 63% of butter’s are. “This explains why like butter and lard coconut oil is solid at room temperature with a long shelf life and the ability to withstand high cooking temperatures” says registered dietitian Lisa Young PhD. And it’s the reason coconut oil has a bad rap from many health officials. But there may be a saving grace. Coconut oil’s saturated fat is made up mostly of medium-chain triglycerides or MCTs. Some people say your body handles them differently than the longer-chain fats in liquid vegetable oils dairy and fatty meats. The American Heart Association says to limit saturated fat to no more than 13 grams a day. That’s the amount found in about one tablespoon of coconut oil. Fans of coconut oil point to studies that suggest the MCT-saturated fat in coconut could boost your HDL or “good” cholesterol. This they claim makes it less bad for your heart health than the saturated fat in animal-based foods like cheese and steak or products containing trans fats. But it also raises your LDL “bad” cholesterol. A quick cholesterol lesson: “But just because coconut oil can raise HDL cholesterol doesn't mean that it’s great for your heart” Young says. “It’s not known if the rise in beneficial cholesterol outweighs any rise in harmful cholesterol.”|

Diabetic retinopathy is a serious complication of type 2 diabetes resulting from a drop-off in blood supply to the patient's retina. According to lead researcher Aleix Sala-Vila it is the most frequent cause of diabetes-related blindness. "We wanted to [see] whether regular consumption of seafood -- fatty fish in particular -- in the absence of any advice to increase seafood consumption or fish oil supplementation decreased the risk of diabetic retinopathy" explained Sala-Vila a researcher at the Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red in Barcelona. Sala-Vila's team focused on patients whose overall diet was already composed of mostly low-fat or plant-based foods. That said the team found that those who consumed at least two servings of fatty fish weekly had a lower risk for diabetic retinopathy than those whose diets included less fish. Study participants were drawn from an earlier trial that had divided Spanish residents with type 2 diabetes into three different groups each assigned to a different diet. The first followed a low-fat diet. The second followed a Mediterranean (plant-based/red meat-free) diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil. And the third also followed a Mediterranean diet supplemented by 30 grams a day of omega-3 rich walnuts hazelnuts and almonds. That study found it was those in the second group who saw their vision risks fall. Working with the same pool of participants Sala-Vila's team then asked about 3600 diabetic men and women between the ages of 55 and 80 to report how often they consumed eight types of seafood before embarking on their assigned diets. Once on their diets Sala-Vila's team tracked seafood consumption habits for nearly five years. The result: The team found that those who routinely consumed 500 milligrams (mg) a day of omega-3 fatty acid in their diets (equal to two servings of fatty fish per week) were 48 percent less likely to develop diabetic retinopathy than those who consumed less.|

The step-by-step training appears to jump-start the connection between brain and body through the use of virtual reality walking simulations specially designed exoskeletons and tactile feedback said senior researcher Dr. Miguel Nicolelis. He is director of the Duke University Center for Neuroengineering. Weekly training with these machines re-awakened undamaged but unused spinal cord nerves that had survived the car crashes falls and other accidents that caused paralysis he said. "These patients didn't have any movement of their limbs and they didn't have any tactile feeling below the level of their injury" Nicolelis said. "After one year of training half of these patients had to be reclassified as partial paraplegic because we could document voluntary movements from these patients." The patients also regained some level of bladder control and bowel function that had been lost due to their spinal cord injury. "They were able for the first time in many years to control their bathroom routine" Nicolelis said. The eight patients all had sustained spinal cord injuries that left their lower bodies completely paralyzed for between three years and 13 years the researchers said. At the beginning of the study investigators asked the patients to think about walking while undergoing a brain scan. The scans found no activity at all in the regions of the brain associated with movement. "That suggests to us the representation of the lower limbs and the idea of locomotion had almost been erased from the brain" Nicolelis said. These patients' training regimen started with at least two hours a week spent in a virtual reality environment where their brains controlled the movement of a three-dimensional avatar walking across a soccer field Nicolelis said. An EEG (electroencephalogram) cap strapped to their heads monitored the brain areas that control movement and translated signals into steps taken by the avatar. At the same time a specially designed shirt produced tiny vibrations on their arms every time the avatar moved providing tactile feedback of each step taken.|

The review also found that pharmacists could manage chronic diseases with about the same efficiency as doctors. However current evidence doesn't show whether pharmacists can actually improve a patient's overall health if they take over someone's care from a doctor said study senior author Dr. Timothy Wilt. He's a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School and a staff physician at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. Wilt and his colleagues also couldn't show whether having a pharmacist manage your care can help you live longer or reduce symptoms caused by chronic ailments such as heart disease or diabetes. "That was a bit frustrating for us because that's really what patients really care about -- will it help them live longer and live better?" Wilt said. The reason for the interest in pharmacist-driven care is that some areas of the United States don't have enough doctors. Due to these shortages other types of health care workers such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants are being called on to help fill the gaps Wilt said. New legislation introduced in Congress would establish pharmacists as health care providers and pay them accordingly through Medicare in communities where there aren't enough doctors the study authors said. Pharmacists acting as a person's primary care provider would be able to evaluate a patient's health advise them how to best manage their chronic conditions and possibly even have the power to order tests or prescribe medicines Wilt said. They also could send patients to a doctor for any procedure they might need such as an injection for knee pain or removal of a wart he said. To determine how well pharmacists might perform if they led the management of a person's chronic disease Wilt and his colleagues reviewed 63 published studies. The studies included 65 different patient populations with more than 33000 people.|

A 70-year-old man with Zika died in February from severe thrombocytopenia which causes a low blood platelet count that can lead to internal bleeding. The death was announced by Puerto Rico's health secretary Ana Rius. So far Puerto Rico has had more than 600 Zika cases including 73 involving pregnant women. All 14 women who have given birth so far have had healthy babies the Associated Press reported. Zika can cause severe birth defects. Sixteen of the Zika patients in Puerto Rico have been hospitalized and four are believed to have developed temporary paralysis due to the mosquito-borne virus according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC is urging all residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico to continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites take precautions to reduce the risk of sexual transmission of the virus and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever. While the Zika virus poses little health risk to most people it poses a significant threat to pregnant women because it can cause a birth defect called microcephaly which results in babies born with abnormally small heads and brains. To control the threat posed by Zika officials in Puerto Rico are pursuing "vector control activities" that include indoor and outdoor spraying of insecticides and reducing mosquito breeding grounds especially around pregnant women's homes the CDC said. As of April 27 there were 1025 confirmed cases of Zika in U.S. states and territories according to the CDC. Nearly all of these infections were acquired by people who had traveled outside the United States. As mosquito season approaches U.S. health experts expect to see more infections in Gulf Coast states such as Florida and Texas as well as Hawaii. Meanwhile new research suggests the Zika virus was circulating in Haiti months before the first cases in Brazil -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- were reported last spring.|

People with the syndrome experience uncomfortable sensations and strong urges to move their legs which can be painful and disrupt sleep according to Dr. William Ondo. He is director of the Movement Disorders Clinic at Houston Methodist Hospital. Nearly 12 million people in the United States have restless legs syndrome according to the American Sleep Association. "Patients with restless legs syndrome already have difficulty sleeping as their symptoms tend to worsen at night or with rest but sedating antihistamines ... can intensify the symptoms" Ondo said in a hospital news release. Many people take sedating antihistamines to treat sneezing runny nose and other symptoms of seasonal allergies. "We don't yet understand why sedating antihistamines worsen restless legs syndrome but we do know that non-sedating antihistamines do not affect the symptoms as much because they do not enter the brain as easily" he said. "It's very frustrating for my patients when a sleeping pill like a sedating antihistamine doesn't help them sleep so I advise them to seek other allergy relief options such as nasal sprays and decongestants" he added. Some people who think they're allergic to sedating antihistamines because the drugs make them feel hyperactive may have undiagnosed restless legs syndrome and should see a doctor Ondo advised.|

The condition is called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. It's believed to affect about 1.5 million people in the United States the researchers said. The genes linked to this condition prevent the liver from removing LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol from the blood. This allows the bad cholesterol to build up. Doctors suspect this familial condition when LDL levels are above 190 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) the study authors explained. The researchers reviewed data from six groups of people involved in previous studies. Compared to people with average LDL cholesterol levels (less than 130 mg/dL) those with familial hypercholesterolemia had a five times higher risk for heart disease. Those with genetically inherited high cholesterol were also more likely to have diseases caused by hardening of the arteries including earlier development of heart disease -- up to 20 years earlier in men and 30 years earlier in women the research revealed. Even when the researchers included other risk factors for heart disease in their analysis the risks were still higher for those with the genetic cholesterol disorder.  The findings may help doctors explain the risks of familial hypercholesterolemia more clearly to patients. That's important because the disorder can be treated with cholesterol-lowering drugs to decrease the risks for coronary heart disease and stroke the investigators said. "Clinician-patient discussions about guideline-supported therapies can be informed by this data" according to the study authors who were led by Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones at Northwestern University in Chicago. Using the data doctors could present certain scenarios to their patients. For example: if a 25-year-old woman with newly diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia leaves her cholesterol untreated her risk of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal heart attack would be comparable to that of a 55-year-old woman the researchers said. "Such an analogy paired with counseling about how to improve risk may motivate behavioral changes as well as adoption of and adherence to evidence-based medications" the study authors said. The findings were published June 29 in the journal Circulation.|

Experts have long focused on so-called mild cognitive impairment as an early warning sign of Alzheimer's disease. That refers to problems with memory and thinking that may or may not progress to full-blown dementia. But now some researchers are zeroing in on a new concept they call "mild behavioral impairment." The term is meant to describe persistent changes in an older person's normal behavior. The changes include problems like social withdrawal angry outbursts anxiety and obsessiveness. "We're not talking about a blip in someone's behavior" said Dr. Zahinoor Ismail of the University of Calgary's Hotchkiss Brain Institute in Canada. "It's a sustained change from their former ways of functioning." And he said "that out-of-character behavior can be the first sign of something going wrong in the brain." So Ismail and his colleagues have developed a symptom checklist that doctors could potentially use to assess older patients for mild behavioral problems. The tool still needs to be studied further but the hope is that it will help spot people in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Ismail was to present the work Sunday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Toronto. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. "People often think [Alzheimer's]|, ||

Researchers found that the drug at least partly reversed organ damage in 60 percent of patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis -- an umbrella term for several rare cancers that affect blood cells called mast cells. Normally mast cells release histamines and other chemicals during inflammatory and allergic reactions. In aggressive cases of systemic mastocytosis abnormal mast cells build up in the bone marrow skin gut spleen liver and lymph nodes. As a result people with the cancers constantly feel sick said Dr. Robert Hromas a blood cancer specialist at the University of Florida. "They're debilitating" he said. "You feel miserable all the time." No good treatment options exist for people with advanced mastocytosis. So the new findings are "a real advance" said Hromas who wasn't involved in the study. "This is a drug that works" he said. "And until now we've really had nothing." The study does not prove that midostaurin extends people's lives said Hromas who is also a spokesman for the American Society of Hematology. But patients who responded to the drug did see most of their symptoms improve and they reported a higher quality of life -- which is important Hromas pointed out. The findings published in the June 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine add to evidence of midostaurin's benefits. The drug a twice-daily pill has already been shown to lengthen the lives of patients with a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. In February the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted midostaurin "breakthrough therapy" status which will speed the agency's review of the drug. As it stands the only drug approved to treat advanced systemic mastocytosis is Gleevec (imatinib). But it doesn't work for most patients said study leader Dr. Jason Gotlib an associate professor of medicine-hematology at Stanford University School of Medicine in Stanford Calif. That's because about 90 percent of patients have tumors with a mutated gene that makes them resistant to Gleevec Gotlib explained.|
Tue Aug 09 18:19:11 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/c3grPmDOew, | Obesity May Age Your Brain|, |['obesity and dementia; obesity and brain volume' 'obesity and dementia risk'] |, |Aug. 9 2016 -- Being overweight or obese in middle age shrinks your brain aging it by as much as 10 years according to a new study. People who are overweight or obese during middle age have brains with much less white matter than people of the same age at a healthy weight says study researcher Lisa Ronan PhD at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. White matter tissue helps the brain’s different areas communicate with each other. Loss of it has been linked with declines in thinking skills. However in this study the researchers did not see a difference in thinking skills between healthy weight and overweight people despite the white matter differences seen on scans of the brain -- a finding that Ronan says surprised her. Other studies have found a link between obesity and a decline in thinking skills as well as getting Alzheimer’s disease at an earlier age. Although Ronan didn’t see the same link in her study experts say losing white matter is not good. ''The white matter of the brain is thought to be the first to go with dementia" says Mike Henne PhD a spokesman for the American Federation for Aging Research. Loss of white matter is generally associated with “foggy-mindedness" he says. White matter declines with age usually beginning in the late 30s so holding on to as much as you can is desirable. "If you lose white matter the [brain's] neurons are not as capable of communicating with each other" says Henne assistant professor of cell biology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The U.K. researchers took brain scans of people about 40 years old to measure the impact of weight on brain structure and the amount of white matter. Of the 473 men and women evaluated 246 were healthy weight 150 overweight and 77 obese. The men and women took a standard test similar to an IQ test to measure their thinking skills. Researchers do not understand exactly how extra weight may affect the brain’s white matter or what having less of it in middle age may mean Ronan says.|

In a study of nearly 4 million men and women around the globe the risk of dying before the age of 70 was 19 percent for men and 11 percent for women of normal weight.  But that risk jumped to 30 percent and 15 percent respectively for obese men and women. That's an absolute increased risk of 11 percent for men and 4 percent for women the researchers reported. "Obesity is second only to smoking as a cause of premature death in America" said lead researcher Richard Peto professor of medical statistics and epidemiology at the University of Oxford in England. "If you could lose about 10 percent of your weight a woman would knock 10 percent off the risk of dying before she was 70 and for a man it would knock about 20 percent off" Peto said. Why obese men are at greater risk for premature death than women isn't clear. "Our study was not able to address this question but previous observations have suggested that obese men have greater insulin resistance liver fat levels and diabetes risk than women" said study co-author Dr. Emanuele Di Angelantonio a lecturer at the University of Cambridge in England. The study was published online July 13 in The Lancet. One U.S. expert said more research is needed to explore the apparent link between obesity and mortality. "We still have more work to do to better understand how weight weight gain and weight loss influence mortality" said Barry Graubard a senior investigator in the biostatistics branch of the U.S. National Cancer Institute. He co-authored an accompanying journal editorial. Avoiding obesity has clear advantages for both men and women Graubard said. "In addition we know from other studies that physical activity can reduce mortality risk" he said. In the new study researchers collected data on 3.9 million adults aged 20 to 90. The information came from 189 previous studies in Europe North America and elsewhere. The investigators included data on all those who lived at least another five years. Over the time of the study nearly 400000 participants died. The study findings showed that underweight people were also at risk for premature death.|

Researchers say states of anxiety are equally as likely as to follow manic episodes as depression. The finding might have implications for better treatment the research team said. "For years we may have missed opportunities to evaluate the effects of treatments for bipolar disorder on anxiety" said study lead author Dr. Mark Olfson a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. "The results of our study suggest that researchers should begin to ask whether and to what extent treatments for bipolar disorder relieve anxiety as well as mania and depression" he added in a university new release. According to the study authors about 5.7 million Americans have bipolar disorder which causes cycles of mania (elevated or irritable mood) and depression. The new findings stem from an analysis of data from more than 34000 American adults with bipolar disorder. "Although it has long been widely assumed that bipolar disorder represents repeated episodes of mania and depression as poles along a single continuum of mood the clinical reality is often far more complex" Olfson said. He said that based on the new findings "patients whose main symptom is anxiety should be carefully assessed for a history of mania before starting treatment." The study was published May 3 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.|

In an analysis of data from eight British population-based surveys the link between drinking alcohol and risk of death from all causes was weaker among people who met or exceeded minimum weekly physical activity recommendations Kadija Perreault PhD from the University of Montreal in Quebec Canada and colleagues report in an article published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Specifically the added risk for dying of cancer tied to drinking was nearly erased among regular exercisers. The findings appear to support previous studies suggesting that drinking alcohol and physical activity are both linked to chronic disease but work in opposite ways the authors write. In a previous study heavy drinking was shown to increase the risk of death by 31% to 54%. A recent review strongly linked alcohol to multiple types of cancer. High levels of physical activity in contrast have been linked to a significantly reduced risk for breast and colon cancer in multiple studies. The current study is one of the first to examine whether an association exists between the health benefits of physical activity and the increased death risk associated with drinking alcohol. Using data from the annual nationally representative Health Survey for England and the Scottish Health Survey that included information about drinking and physical activity scientists looked at 36370 adults aged 40 and older. Of them 4845 people drank more than recommended weekly alcohol limits -- 14 drinks for women and 21 for men. Among people who reported having had a drink during the previous week the average amount was slightly more than six drinks. Across the study population more than a quarter of the participants (27.5%) reported no physical activity meaning they didn’t get the recommended 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise weekly. Thirty-nine percent achieved the minimum amount and about 23% reported exercising more. Occasional drinking appeared to help protect against deaths from all causes and heart disease deaths among adults who got the recommended amount of exercise according to the researchers. The study emphasizes the role exercise can play in health even if people engage in unhealthy behaviors the researchers write. SOURCE: Perreault K.

The Australian-based research found that one-third of patients with advanced irreversible chronic conditions were given treatments that didn't necessarily benefit them -- including admission to intensive care or chemotherapy -- in the last two weeks of their life. The study also revealed that one-quarter of older patients who had Do-Not-Resuscitate orders were still given cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). People with serious conditions were subjected to invasive procedures unnecessary scans and blood tests intensive heart monitoring and other treatments that did little to alter their outcomes sometimes against their wishes the researchers found. "It is not unusual for family members to refuse to accept the fact that their loved one is naturally dying of old age and its associated complications and so they pressure doctors to attempt heroic interventions" said study leader Dr. Magnolia Cardona-Morrell. She is with the University of New South Wales' Simpson Centre for Health Services Research. "Doctors also struggle with the uncertainty of the duration of the dying trajectory and are torn by the ethical dilemma of delivering what they were trained to do save lives versus respecting the patient's right to die with dignity" she said in a university news release. The new research involved a large analysis of 38 studies done in 10 countries during the past 20 years. The review included 1.2 million doctors patients and their relatives. "Our findings indicate the persistent ambiguity or conflict about what treatment is deemed beneficial and a culture of 'doing everything possible' " Cardona-Morrell said. One possible explanation for the excess tests and treatments is that significant medical advancements have led to unrealistic expectations about the ability of doctors and treatments to ensure patients' survival the researchers noted. As the population of older and frail people grows doctors and caregivers must be able to better recognize when death is imminent and unavoidable the researchers suggested. More training will help doctors lose their fear of a wrong prognosis and identify patients near the end of their lives they added. "More importantly we have identified measurable indicators and strategies to minimize this type of intervention. An honest and open discussion with patients or their families is a good start to avoid non-beneficial treatments. We hope hospitals can monitor these indicators during their quality improvement activities" Cardona-Morrell said. The review was published June 27 in the International Journal for Quality in Health Care.|

A new study suggests that may be possible particularly if you have good genes. "Chronic disease is not an inevitable part of aging" said Dr. Sofiya Milman an assistant professor of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. "An extended period of good health can accompany a long life span and is an achievable goal." Milman is one of the authors of a U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded study on aging.  Americans are living longer than ever. In 2014 the average life expectancy at birth had reached nearly 79 years according to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. A century earlier it was just slightly over 54 years. But gains in "health span -- the period of time that people live in good health -- have not kept pace with longevity the study authors noted. Rather longer life expectancy has been associated with greater disability. Of course some people are beating the odds outliving their average life expectancy surviving near the limit of the human life span and spending fewer years sick and disabled.  How do they do it? Using data from two previous studies researchers from Albert Einstein and Boston University examined whether people experienced similar delays in the onset of disease and disability before death. One study the Longevity Genes Project included Ashkenazi Jewish people who at age 95 were living independently. For comparison the study also included a group of somewhat younger Ashkenazi Jews with no parental history of longevity.  The research team also drew data from the New England Centenarian Study which included 100 year olds living in eight towns in the Boston area as well as in England Ireland Australia and New Zealand. It also included people without a family predisposition of exceptional longevity for comparison. Researchers then compared the health of 439 long-lived people and their 696 somewhat younger counterparts aged 53 to 93 from the Longevity Genes Program with the health of 1498 long-lived participants and 302 comparison participants aged 49 to 89 from the New England Centenarian Study.|

In fact a new study reports the average delay is six years. That lost time can result in greater frequency and severity of episodes of the psychiatric condition the researchers said. "While some patients particularly those who present with psychosis probably do receive timely treatment the diagnosis of the early phase of bipolar disorder can be difficult" study leader Matthew Large a professor psychiatry at the University of New South Wales Australia said in a school news release. "This is because mental health clinicians are sometimes unable to distinguish the depressed phase of bipolar disorder from other types of depression" he added. The new research reviewed the results of 27 past studies. Those studies included more than 9400 patients. Many patients had distressing and disruptive symptoms for many years before they received proper treatment the researchers noted. The delay in diagnosis and treatment was often longer for young patients because symptoms such as moodiness can sometimes be mistaken by parents and doctors as just part of being a teen the study authors said. "The diagnosis of bipolar disorder can also be missed because it relies on a detailed life history and corroborative information from careers and family information that takes time and care to gather" Large explained. He recommended that doctors look more closely at a patient's history of mood symptoms especially distinct changes in mood and mood swings caused by outside events such as overseas travel or treatment with antidepressants. He also suggested a closer look at mood symptoms in people who have a family history of the disorder.  A long delay in diagnosis and treatment is "a lost opportunity because the severity and frequency of episodes can be reduced with medication and other interventions" Large said. The study was published July 25 in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.|

But a new study suggests that older adults are generally less stressed and happier with their lives than younger people are. The study which included adults aged 21 to 99 found that on average mental well-being steadily improved as people grew older. And that was despite the fact that older adults had more physical health issues and problems with memory and thinking versus younger people. The reasons are not completely clear. But researchers pointed to some likely explanations -- including the perspective and "wisdom" that comes from life experience. Teenagers and younger adults can be upset by not getting enough "likes" on their Facebook post noted Dr. Dilip Jeste the senior researcher on the study. "When you're young everything is so important. And getting approval from others is critical" said Jeste director of the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of California San Diego. As people grow older they typically gain a better sense of what really matters to them and they're less likely to sweat the small things he said. That's probably part of what's going on agreed James Maddux a senior scholar at the Center for the Advancement of Well-Being at George Mason University in Fairfax Va. "Research shows that people get better at emotional regulation over time" said Maddux who was not involved in the new study. "Life experience gives you perspective. You know the downs don't last and the ups don't last." The findings published Aug. 24 in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry are based on surveys of more than 1500 San Diego-area adults. In general physical health conditions and memory issues were more common among older adults. But people in their 20s and 30s reported the highest levels of stress depression and anxiety. Overall mental health steadily improved with age the researchers found. Since the study didn't follow the same people over time the findings don't show that stressed-out young adults eventually become happier Jeste explained. There could also be some generational differences at work for example.|

Avoid Miami Beach due to Zika|, |['zika' 'zika virus' 'zika infection' 'Miami' 'Miami Beach' 'Florida' 'pregnant' 'pregnancy' 'birth defects' 'microcephaly' 'CDC' 'centers for disease control and prevention'] |, |FRIDAY Aug. 19 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Federal health officials are urging pregnant women to avoid travel to Miami Beach after Florida Gov. Rick Scott confirmed on Friday that five cases of locally transmitted Zika virus have occurred there. Until now local transmission of mosquito-borne Zika -- which can cause devastating birth defects in babies -- has been restricted to a neighborhood in north Miami known as Wynwood. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had already advised that pregnant women not travel to the Wynwood area and on Friday the agency extended that advisory to include the Zika-affected area of Miami Beach. "We believe we have a new area where local transmission is occurring in Miami Beach" Scott told reporters during a noon news conference. The five cases include three men and two women two of whom are local residents and three who were tourists visiting from New York Texas and Taiwan. The area involving this latest cluster of cases includes 1.5 square miles between 8th and 28th streets in Miami Beach said Scott who added that there are now 36 confirmed cases of local Zika infection statewide. "Pregnant women should avoid travel to the designated area of Miami Beach in addition to the designated area of Wynwood because active local transmission of Zika has been confirmed" CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a media briefing held Friday. A broader travel advisory for pregnant women could threaten tourism and heighten fears for pregnant women living in the Miami area. The Zika virus is typically transmitted via mosquitoes and can cause a transient illness. It is most dangerous to pregnant women due to the virus' link to microcephaly a devastating birth defect where babies are born with smaller than normal heads and underdeveloped brains. Officials continue to struggle with controlling mosquitos in the Wynwood area of Miami Frieden said. "Although the state of Florida with CDC's assistance has mounted and continues to mount an aggressive response the mosquitos are persistent and we won't know for at least another couple of weeks if these aggressive control measures have worked" Frieden said Friday.|

Between 1970 and 2010 the average life span for men increased 9.2 years to 76.2 years of age and for women it increased 6.4 years to 81 years of age according to the report. However the number of years lived with a disability rose 4.7 years among men and 3.6 years among women while the number of disability-free years increased by 4.5 years for men and 2.7 years for women the findings showed. "We could be increasing the length of poor-quality life more than good-quality life" said lead author Eileen Crimmins. She is a professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California Davis School of Gerontology. "There are a number of indications that the baby boomer generation that is now reaching old age is not seeing improvements in health similar to the older groups that went before them" she said in a university news release. The investigators found that only those 65 and older experienced what they called a "compression of morbidity" -- a reduction in the proportion of years spent with disability. The findings are important for policy proposals such as raising the age for Social Security and Medicare eligibility the researchers said. "Clearly there is a need to maintain health and reduce disability at younger ages to have meaningful compression of morbidity across the age range" Crimmins said. "The trends for the last 40 years do not support projections and policies that are based on assumptions of a reduced length of disabled life." The study was published online April 14 in the American Journal of Public Health.|

Brain scans of 40 former NFL players age 36 on average found that nearly 43 percent had significantly more damage to the brain's white matter than healthy adults the same age researchers said. Also testing showed about half had significant problems following through on goals and more than two out of five had learning memory or attention problems. "This is another piece of the puzzle that playing football places people at risk for traumatic brain injury that may cause problems later in life" said lead researcher Dr. Francis Conidi from the Florida Center for Headache and Sports Neurology in Port St. Lucie. Traumatic brain injury may be a precursor to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) a progressive degenerative disease of the brain Conidi said. "It's important to prevent traumatic brain injury because there is nothing you can do when they reach CTE" he said. Conidi added that one-third of people with traumatic brain injuries go on to develop Alzheimer's CTE or other neurodegenerative diseases. The NFL which for years disputed the notion that head injuries led to brain damage said in a statement that it values studies of this kind. "It is clear there are long-term health risks associated with sustaining head injuries" said an NFL spokesman. "Studies of this nature are important to further advancing the science and better understanding these risks." One way to reduce the danger of traumatic brain injury in football is to limit hitting in practice Conidi said "because the damage is most likely cumulative." "You can't take the hitting completely away without compromising the game" Conidi said. However "there is an accepted risk by the athlete" he added. "As long as we can present the information that you may have problems later in life they can make an informed decision." Another expert welcomed the report. "Overall this is a significant study highlighting the potential damage that can occur over time especially in professional sports" said Dr. Mohan Kottapally an assistant professor of clinical neurology and neurocritical care at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.|

"This greater than expected survival in older patients selected for operative therapy is noteworthy especially considering that the prevalence of lung cancer is expected to increase as the population continues to grow older and more people survive into old age" said study author Dr. Felix Fernandez from Emory Clinic in Atlanta. The median age of U.S. lung cancer patients at the time of diagnosis is 70 according to the American Cancer Society. About 17 percent of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer live for at least five years according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute. In the study researchers examined data from tens of thousands of patients aged 65 and older who had lung cancer surgery in the United States between 2002 and 2012. Median survival after surgery for early stage lung cancer was 6.7 years -- nearly two years longer than the benchmark five-year survival rate. The analysis also showed that five-year survival rates for certain older patients with advanced lung cancer who had surgery were 30 percent for stage 3 cancer and 27 percent for stage 4 cancer. The study was published online May 5 in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery. The findings offer more information about survival after surgery "which is important to patients. This information can be included in the shared decision-making process when discussing treatment options with patients" Fernandez said in a journal news release. The elderly population in the United States is expected to nearly double from 43 million in 2012 to 80 million by 2050 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.|

The procedure called prostatic artery embolization (PAE) involves placing microscopic spheres in the arteries that supply blood to the prostate gland to partially block the blood flow. Reducing blood flow to the prostate causes the gland to soften and shrink said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla an interventional radiologist at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. In their new study Bagla and his colleagues show that PAE improves symptoms in men suffering from nocturia -- waking up repeatedly during the night to urinate. "Their urinary symptoms bothered them considerably less and their quality of life also showed marked improvement" Bagla said. "The improvement in quality of life stems directly from the fact that these men are getting a better night's sleep." The findings were scheduled to be presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting in Vancouver. In PAE doctors insert a catheter into the femoral artery at the top of the leg and guide it to the prostate artery on both sides of the enlarged gland. Microbeads made of a durable biologic compound are inserted into the artery to block blood flow the researchers said. The study included 68 men who had the procedure done. Researchers were able to reach 46 of these patients one month later for follow-up and all 46 reported fewer urinary symptoms and a better quality of life. After three months 38 men who underwent the procedure were reached for follow-up and 28 showed improvement with average nighttime urination events decreasing from more than three episodes to fewer than two per night the researchers reported. Doctors aren't sure yet why men experience relief from the procedure because previous studies have not shown a direct link between reduction of the prostate gland and symptom improvement Bagla said. "Much of the improvement may be related to the fact that there's softening of the prostatic gland" he said. "This hard enlarged gland becomes softened and the urethra allows easier passage of urine."|

The researchers said these disruptions occur in areas of the brain involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness as well as cognitive function. The researchers explained that white matter tracts are bundles made up of long fibers of nerve cells that connect one part of the brain to another. "If white matter tracts are impaired communication between brain regions is disrupted" said researcher Shumei Li. She's from the department of Medical Imaging at Guangdong No. 2 Provincial People's Hospital Guangzhou China. Although the study found an association between white tract matter abnormalities and insomnia it wasn't designed to prove cause-and-effect. People with primary insomnia have ongoing trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. This nightly tossing and turning isn't related to another medical condition or known cause according to the researchers. It can lead to daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairment. Some people with primary insomnia also suffer from depression and anxiety disorders the researchers said. Up to 5 percent of adults have this sleep disorder but it's unclear exactly why they can't sleep and how the condition affects their brain the researchers noted. "Insomnia is a remarkably prevalent disorder" said Li. "However its causes and consequences remain elusive." For the study the researchers recruited 23 patients with primary insomnia and 30 healthy volunteers. All of the participants completed surveys that enabled study authors to evaluate their mental status and sleep patterns. Using an advanced MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) the researchers also looked at the pattern of water movement in white matter to identify any irregularities. They found that participants with insomnia had significantly reduced white matter "integrity" in several regions of the brain. One area was the thalamus which regulates consciousness sleep and alertness. Another was the corpus callosum the area that bridges the two halves of the brain the study authors said.|

Adults who ate fresh fruit such as apples and oranges every day had about a one-third reduced risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke compared to those who rarely or never ate fruit researchers found. "Fruit consumption is important for your cardiovascular health" said lead researcher Dr. Liming Li vice president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing. Study participants who ate fruit most often had lower blood pressure and blood sugar than less frequent fruit eaters which may account for the reduced risk for heart attacks and strokes Li said. Due to the nature of the study however it could not prove that fruit consumption caused the lower risk of heart attack and stroke just that there was an association Li said. For the study Li and colleagues collected data on more than 500000 adults ages 30 to 79 between 2004 and 2009. None had a history of heart disease. Fewer than one in five ate fruit on a daily basis. Over seven years those who ate the equivalent of roughly a half cup of fruit a day had significantly lower risks of major cardiovascular diseases the study found. The report was published April 7 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Two U.S. experts weighed in on the study findings. "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of avoidable and premature death globally" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow a professor of cardiology at the University of California Los Angeles. Previous studies have suggested that diets high in fruit are associated with a lower risk of heart disease. However few of these studies have involved Asian countries he noted. "Further studies are needed to determine if eating more fruit will result in meaningful health gains" Fonarow said. Samantha Heller a senior clinical nutritionist at New York University Medical Center said fruit is a great addition to your diet.|

Needle-sharing among prescription drug addicts created an outbreak in rural Scott County Ind. Public health officials report HIV infected 181 people there between November 2014 and November 2015. "It was the largest outbreak that has occurred in the U.S. since the introduction of HIV treatment" said lead author Dr. Philip Peters a medical officer with the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "And it occurred in a poor and rural community. We have not seen HIV outbreaks in these types of communities before." Many of the infected people had crushed and cooked down the extended-release form of the opioid pain pill oxymorphone (Opana ER). The result was an injectable slurry which increased potency and dodged drug-making technologies intended to prevent abuse Peters said. But the dose created by this process proved too powerful. "The amount of opiates in one crushed pill that has been cooked into a drug slurry is more than one person could shoot" Peters said. "It naturally led to sharing the same drug slurry among multiple people." More frequent needle-sharing was related to a higher risk of infection with HIV the AIDS-causing virus the study authors said. "This particular community is rural and also very poor and there wasn't really any access to clean syringes" Peters continued. "If persons started to inject drugs they didn't have many options other than to share syringes. That is probably a factor that caused such rapid transmission of HIV." The case report appears in the July 21 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Moving on to an injectable slurry is a "natural progression of use" for people who are hooked on opiates said Emily Feinstein director of health law and policy with the U.S. National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse.|

The procedures are: partial removal of the large or small intestine; surgery to repair a bleeding or torn ulcer; separating abdominal organs that have adhered to each other; appendix removal; gall bladder removal; and open-abdominal surgery. Researchers found these operations also account for 80 percent of complications from emergency general surgery a specialty that focuses primarily on abdominal health problems.  "Our gastrointestinal tract is just so specialized and so critical to our existence. We think it's easy to operate on but then in practice it's very difficult for patients" said senior author Dr. Joaquim Havens an instructor in trauma and emergency surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "We find that even patients who undergo open heart surgery can have better outcomes than patients that undergo open intestinal surgery." In this study published April 27 in JAMA Surgery Havens and his colleagues looked at procedures that meet the definition of emergency general surgery as created by the American Association of Surgery for Trauma he said. These mainly include operations to deal with gastrointestinal problems soft tissue infections and hernias. The researchers focused on emergency general surgery performed within two days of hospital admission due to a serious medical condition. Heart-related procedures and surgery prompted by traumatic events like car crashes were excluded from the analysis.  More than 3 million Americans undergo emergency general surgery every year the authors said in background information. Emergency general surgery is inherently more risky because it is performed with little to no advance planning or preparation on patients who are in dire straits Havens said. They typically are suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding a bowel obstruction or severe infections of the digestive tract. As a result people forced to undergo emergency surgery are up to eight times more likely to die following their operation than patients who undergo the same procedure on an elective basis the authors noted.|

"Depression continues to affect a large proportion of the population many of whom do not respond to conventional treatments" said Dr. Scott Krakower a psychiatrist who reviewed the study. "Although this was a small study it does offer hope for new unconventional treatments to help those who are battling with severe depression" said Krakower who is chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks N.Y. The new trial included 12 people with moderate to severe depression who had been resistant to standard treatment. All of the patients were given the compound psilocybin found in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Three months after treatment seven patients had reduced symptoms of depression according to a team led by Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris of Imperial College London in England. There were no serious side effects the study authors said in the report published May 17 in The Lancet Psychiatry. Carhart-Harris' team stressed that no strong conclusions can be made from the findings -- only that further research is warranted. About 1 in 5 patients with depression does not respond to treatments such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy the study authors noted. "This is the first time that psilocybin has been investigated as a potential treatment for major depression" Carhart-Harris said in a journal news release. "The results are encouraging and we now need larger trials to understand whether the effects we saw in this study translate into long-term benefits and to study how psilocybin compares to other current treatments" he said. How might the drug work to ease depression? "Previous animal and human brain imaging studies have suggested that psilocybin may have effects similar to other antidepressant treatments" explained study senior author David Nutt also of Imperial College London. "Psilocybin targets the serotonin receptors in the brain" he said "just as most antidepressants do but it has a very different chemical structure to currently available antidepressants and acts faster than traditional antidepressants."|

The procedure called a cervical stitch is performed on roughly 2 million women a year worldwide who are considered at high risk of miscarriage or premature birth. To delay labor doctors place a stitch in the cervix to keep it closed. But researchers found the most commonly used suture -- a braided thread -- was associated with tripled odds of stillbirth compared to a single-strand suture. And risk of preterm birth was nearly doubled. "We don't have very good tools for determining who would and who would not benefit from that operation and probably put cervical stitches in many women who don't really need them so it's important that we first do no harm" said researcher Dr. Phillip Bennett a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Imperial College London. Bennett said about 80 percent of doctors who do the procedure use the braided tape-like material. Just one in five uses a simple nylon thread that's like a fishing line. "We found that women who had the braided tape material had significantly poorer outcomes than the women who had the nylon" he said. These women were more likely to have harmful bacteria grow in the vagina Bennett said. This was associated with inflammation and changes to the cervix. "We didn't see any of those changes when we used the nylon stitch" he said. "We think the tape stitch allows bad bacteria to grow in the vagina and that then affects the cervix through activation of inflammation" he added. Among nearly 700 women who had the procedure 15 percent who got the braided "shoe lace" stitch had a stillbirth compared with 5 percent of those who had the nylon suture. In addition 27 percent of women who received the braided tape gave birth prematurely compared with 17 percent of women who got the nylon stitch Bennett said. Bennett said that as a result of this study a head-to-head comparison is now being done in the U.K. Results are expected in a couple of years.|

The mosquito-borne virus is already suspected of causing a birth defect called microcephaly -- characterized by an abnormally small head and brain -- and a nervous system disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome. Now a new study reports a possible link between Zika and an autoimmune disorder known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). In this disease the immune system attacks the coating (myelin) around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord much like multiple sclerosis. "Though our study is small it may provide evidence that in this case the virus has different effects on the brain than those identified in current studies" said study author Dr. Maria Lucia Brito Ferreira of Restoration Hospital Recife Brazil. The study results released April 10 will be presented April 15 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Vancouver Canada. Research presented at meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. "Much more research will need to be done to explore whether there is a causal link between Zika and these brain problems" Ferreira added in an academy news release. In Guillain-Barre the immune system attacks the nervous system resulting in muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Zika which is prevalent in Latin America and the Caribbean is mainly transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes aegyptimosquitoes. Most healthy people infected with the virus experience no symptoms but babies whose mothers were exposed to the virus in pregnancy appear to be at special risk for microcephaly. The new research indicates the virus might have implications for others as well. The new study focused on six people who developed neurologic symptoms after arriving at a hospital in Recife between December 2014 and June 2015. All reported symptoms consistent with the family of viruses that includes Zika dengue and chikungunya. These symptoms included fever followed by a rash and in some cases severe itching muscle and joint pain and red eyes.|

The goal is to make 10 years’ worth of progress in half the time. The program is called the Cancer Moonshot. It’s a reference to the U.S. push in the 1960s to be the first nation to put a man on the moon. It worked for space travel. Now the question is whether a big government-funded initiative can turn the tide against cancer. To find out WebMD spoke to Walter Curran MD executive director of Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University in Atlanta. Curran will participate in a panel discussion on Wednesday at the annual Health Connect South conference in Atlanta called “Can the Cancer Moonshot Succeed?” The interview has been edited for clarity and length. WebMD: What’s happened with the Cancer Moonshot so far? Curran: Biden has been very busy and very engaged to learn all he can about the current state of cancer research in the country. He convened a panel that’s referred to as a blue ribbon panel to define priorities for this effort. The blue ribbon panel came out with this report just last week [Sept. 7]|, ||

Over 13 percent of adults surveyed in 2014 said they'd used marijuana in the previous year up from roughly 10 percent in 2002. Also daily or near daily use -- five days or more a week -- rose from less than 2 percent to almost 4 percent of adults during that time period. "This increase has corresponded with the legal and social acceptance of marijuana and so it is not such a surprise" said lead study author Dr. Wilson Compton deputy director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.  He pointed out that over the past 20 years medical marijuana has been legalized in 25 states and the District of Columbia. However noting that marijuana's potency has increased Compton's team said education about the harms of pot is essential. "We need to think about how to do appropriate prevention messaging to make sure people aren't putting themselves at risk for becoming dependent and other problems associated with the drug" he said. These harms could include "difficulty with their work performance and with their ability to think clearly and function" Compton said. For the report -- published Aug. 31 in The Lancet Psychiatry -- researchers surveyed nearly 600000 adults from 2002 to 2014. Based on the findings the researchers estimated that the overall number of marijuana users increased from 22 million to 32 million during that period with first-time marijuana users jumping from more than 800000 to 1.4 million. Daily users numbered more than 8 million in 2014 -- more than twice as many as in 2002 the study authors determined. Greater pot use was associated with a drop in the percentage of people who associate smoking marijuana with harm. Where just one-third of Americans once considered marijuana safe now half do according to the report. Despite greater usage rates of marijuana abuse or dependence held steady in the general population at about 1.5 percent from 2002 to 2014. But among pot users only the rate of marijuana abuse or dependence dropped from 15 percent to 11 percent the researchers found.|

The doctors said that the children -- aged 2 and 5 -- developed iodine deficiency because their diets lacked salt dairy products bread and other sources of the mineral. Iodine deficiency is common in developing countries but was virtually eliminated in the United States after iodized salt was introduced almost a century ago. However it can still happen if a child's diet is strictly limited said study author Dr. Brigid Gregg. She is a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. "Parents should be aware that if they're really restricting the foods their children eat iodine deficiency is a possibility" Gregg said. The body needs iodine to make thyroid hormones which help control metabolism and other essential functions. Lacking iodine the thyroid gland can become underactive -- what's known as hypothyroidism. In infants and young children that can result in stunted growth and even brain damage Gregg pointed out. Still she said when a young child is not growing well hypothyroidism is "not the first thing that jumps to mind." And when hypothyroidism is suspected doctors would not immediately think iodine deficiency is at the root of the problem she added. "We don't typically think of it in this country because we've considered the problem 'solved' in the U.S." Gregg said. One of the children her team treated was 5 years old and had been diagnosed with autism. His parents were keeping him on a gluten-free casein-free diet -- which meant he wasn't getting the dairy products and grains that are major iodine sources in the typical American diet. His parents brought him to the pediatrician because he was suffering from fatigue and chronic constipation which are two symptoms of hypothyroidism. The doctor discovered the boy had a goiter or an enlarged thyroid gland. From there the boy was tested for autoimmune thyroid disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the gland. But there was no evidence that his immune system had turned against him.|

Just 19 states require elementary school students to take physical education classes for a set amount of time and only 15 set minimum rules for middle school students. Only Oregon and the District of Columbia require the amount of physical education time recommended by national experts. That's 150 minutes a week for elementary students and 225 minutes for older kids. In 62 percent of states students are allowed to substitute other activities for their required physical education credit. Many states let schools withhold physical activity or use it to punish students according to the 2016 Shape of the Nation report. The report was released by Voices for Healthy Kids an initiative of the American Heart Association and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and by SHAPE America -- Society of Health and Physical Educators. "The benefits of physical education ring clear as a school bell" Nancy Brown chief executive officer of the American Heart Association said in a Voices for Health Kids news release. "With effective physical education we can keep kids' hearts healthy and their minds in gear to do their best at school every day." The good news is that school districts under a recent law will be able to get federal funding to improve their programs the report said. SOURCE: Voices for Healthy Kids news release April 8 2016|
Sun Sep 18 13:39:29 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/tfByIQ1ox0, | What's Behind the Gluten-Free Trend?|, |['gluten-free diets' 'gluten-free and celiac disease' 'gluten-free diets' 'non-celiac gluten sensitivity' 'gluten sensitivity' 'people who avoid gluten'] |, |Sept. 16 2016 -- Not that many years ago the letters "GF" on a restaurant menu would likely have puzzled many people. No longer. These days a gluten-free lifestyle has become one of the most popular diet trends in the U.S. One in five people now reduce or eliminate gluten a protein found in wheat barley or rye in their diet according to a 2015 Gallup poll. Avoiding gluten is crucial for people with celiac disease. That’s because in them gluten damages the small intestine and nutrients can't be absorbed. Its symptoms include diarrhea constipation bloating and pain. But only about 1% of the population has celiac disease and that number hasn’t changed in recent years says Hyun-seok Kim MD a doctor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark. In a study released earlier this month he looked at a national survey taken from 2009 to 2014. Although celiac disease numbers remained stable during that time the number of people following a gluten-free diet tripled from 0.5% of the population to nearly 2%. The study's researchers say that some who follow a gluten-free diet without a diagnosis of celiac disease may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity. People with non-celiac gluten sensitivity have similar symptoms but don’t have celiac disease. People with a wheat allergy may also follow the diet to prevent an allergic reaction. But do others need to go gluten-free? Nearly 100 million Americans say they ate gluten-free products in 2015 says William F. Balistreri MD a doctor at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Americans spent an estimated $4 billion on gluten-free products in 2015 he says. Kim’s research has found that women are more likely than men to avoid gluten and the diet is more popular among 20- to 39-year-olds. It’s also popular among world-class athletes. In another survey 41% of 910 world-class athletes and Olympic medalists said they followed a gluten-free diet at least half the time and most had self-diagnosed their gluten sensitivity. Among the many stars reportedly going gluten-free are Gwyneth Paltrow Russell Crowe and Kim Kardashian.|

But the researchers added while these restaurants appear to be making some progress in providing lower-calorie menu options the meals are still packed with too much salt and fat. "The industry has started to make some changes but it's focusing mostly on calories. Improvements are needed to consistently offer healthier combinations" said study co-author Christina Economos. She is an associate professor at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition in Boston. The investigators looked at online nutrition information for children's meal options in 2014. The research included the 10 most popular fast-food outlets: Arby's Burger King Chik-Fil-A Dairy Queen Jack-in-the-Box KFC McDonald's Sonic Subway and Wendy's. It also included the 10 most popular sit-down restaurant chains: Applebee's Buffalo Wild Wings Chili's Denny's IHOP Olive Garden Outback Steakhouse Red Lobster Red Robin and TGI Friday's. The study focused on the numerous combinations that children could create from the options for their meals at each restaurant. For example a burger and fries could come with a variety of soft drink options. According to the results 72 percent of fast-food meals and 63 percent of sit-down meals had 600 calories or less meaning they met recommended calorie guidelines. The researchers believe these options offer fewer calories than in the past. "We can encourage parents to look at the menus and the nutrition numbers and try to construct meals that fall within that 600-calorie guideline" Economos said. However only 32 percent of meal combinations at fast-food restaurants and 22 percent of those at sit-down restaurants met guidelines for fat saturated fat and salt (sodium) as well as calories. In both types of restaurants "the calorie target was most frequently met and the sodium target the least" the study authors reported. The researchers declined to identify which restaurants did the best and worst. Timing is one reason Economos said: "If we were to single out a restaurant and finger point they may have made some changes in the last month."|

"We identified two types of bacteria that are associated with a higher risk for pancreatic cancer and have been tied in the past to such diseases as periodontitis or inflammation of the gums" explained lead researcher Jiyoung Ahn. She's an associate professor of population health at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. Ahn stressed however that her team found only an association and "cannot tell if this bacteria causes the cancer." One strain of mouth bacteria was associated with a 59 percent higher risk for pancreatic cancer in people who carried it while the other was linked to a 119 percent greater risk of the cancer the researchers said. Those numbers reflect a person's risk of developing pancreatic cancer compared to people without the bacteria. The absolute risk of any one person developing a pancreatic cancer remains low however. The U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that about 46000 Americans are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year. Because it is often diagnosed only in its later stages pancreatic cancer has an especially high death rate. The pancreas makes digestive juices and hormones such as insulin which help control blood sugar. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking obesity a history of diabetes and a family history of the disease according to the NCI. For the 10-year study the researchers tested oral samples taken from 361 participants who were healthy at the start of the trial but later developed pancreatic cancer. The researchers compared these samples to those taken from 371 individuals who didn't get pancreatic cancer during that time frame. How might a bacterial infection in the mouth raise cancer risks in other organs? Ahn speculated that people who carry these germs might be susceptible to inflammation and inflammation has been linked to cancer. She added that -- if borne out in future research -- the study results might lead to new ways to screen for pancreatic cancer. In the future scientists might also develop antibiotics or probiotics to control the oral bacteria Ahn said.|

It's estimated that about half of those who undergo chemotherapy for cancer develop what's often called "chemo brain." For instance they may have trouble following conversations or remembering the steps in a project according to background notes with the new study. Although usually mild these changes can affect quality of life job performance and relationships said the researchers from the Eastern Maine Medical Center and Lafayette Family Cancer Center in Bangor Maine. The researchers developed a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program called Memory and Attention Adaptation Training to help cancer survivors prevent or manage these memory problems. Their study involved 47 breast cancer survivors who underwent chemotherapy an average of four years earlier. Some were assigned to receive eight CBT sessions that lasted about 30 to 45 minutes each. The rest received supportive talk therapy sessions. For both groups the sessions were conducted via videoconference to minimize patients' travel time. Participants also completed thinking tests and answered questionnaires about their memory issues and related anxiety. Verbal memory and processing speed was also tested. Participants were retested after completing all eight sessions and again two months later. The CBT participants reported significantly fewer memory problems and better processing speed than those who received supportive therapy according to the study published online May 2 in the journal CANCER. They also reported much less anxiety about mental problems two months after their psychotherapy ended. "This is what we believe is the first randomized study with an active control condition that demonstrates improvement in cognitive symptoms in breast cancer survivors with long-term memory complaints" said study leader Robert Ferguson in a journal news release. He is currently at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. "Participants reported reduced anxiety and high satisfaction with this cognitive-behavioral non-drug approach" Ferguson said. Also because treatment was delivered via videoconference device he said the study demonstrates it's possible "to improve access to survivorship care."

Fri May 06 16:18:02 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/xL9VwpsEAu, | Harsh Parenting May Harm a Child's Physical Health|, |['Problems might last into early adulthood' 'study suggests'] |, |FRIDAY May 6 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Harsh parenting may leave more than psychological scars it might also leave lasting physical problems -- such as obesity -- even into young adulthood new research suggests. And having one kind caring parent doesn't seem to counteract the effects of the harsh parent. "Harshness as we measured it is always bad for kids. But it is particularly bad if the adolescent perceives high levels of warmth and support from the other parent" said study lead author Thomas Schofield. The researchers defined "harsh" parenting as angry hostile and antisocial. Until now "we did not know if parenting that was harsh -- while not falling into the category of abuse -- could predict physical health" said Schofield an assistant professor of human development and family studies at Iowa State University. For the study Schofield and his colleagues examined the results of a study of 451 children. All were seventh-grade students in eight Iowa counties in 1989.  The researchers studied their families even videotaping how they interacted in their homes. Then the investigators followed the children's health through age 20. All of the families lived in small towns or on farms. All were white and spoke English. The study authors also asked kids questions about their health and whether their parents showed warmth to them by expressing caring or appreciation.  The findings showed evidence that harsh parenting appears to have a measurable impact on the health of kids. When parents were "hostile angry and antisocial towards their adolescent" Schofield said the kids were more likely to report declines in their physical health and to gain extra weight.  Meanwhile "warmth from the second parent did not consistently buffer or protect the adolescent from the harshness from the first parent" he said.  When the researchers looked at body mass index (BMI) -- a ratio of weight to height -- they found that the harmful effects of the harsh parent on BMI increased even as the warmth of the other parent went up. Still "we cannot prove harsh parenting was the cause" of worse health Schofield said.|

People are more likely to develop an irregular heartbeat following the death of their spouse or life partner particularly if they're younger or the loved one died unexpectedly a new study suggests. Risk of atrial fibrillation -- a quivering or irregular heartbeat that can cause stroke and heart disease -- was 41 percent higher among people mourning the death of their partner compared to others who are not grieving Danish researchers report. The study reinforces earlier research that has suggested a link between heart rhythm problems and emotional turmoil said Dr. Mark Estes director of the New England Cardiac Arrhythmia Center at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. "Many patients describe that their atrial fibrillation gets worse at a time of emotional stress" Estes said. "This really validates prior observations. It's something we hear from our patients all the time." People younger than 60 were more than twice as likely to develop atrial fibrillation if they lost their partner the new study reported. In addition those whose partners were relatively healthy in the month before they died were 57 percent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation. This increased risk was not seen in people whose partners were ailing and expected to die soon. In both cases it appears that the shock of the death added to the impact of the event on the survivor's health said Dr. Mary Norine Walsh medical director of heart failure and cardiac transplantation at St. Vincent Heart Center in Indianapolis. "This suggests the suddenness or the unexpectedness of the death contributed to the risk of a-fib" said Walsh who also is vice president of the American College of Cardiology. "The people who were older and suffered a loss maybe their loss was more expected." For the study researchers compared more than 88600 Danish people newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with 886120 healthy people matched for age and sex between 1995 and 2014. People who lost their partner were not only at greater risk for an abnormal heart rhythm but the risk was independent of gender and other conditions that might contribute to the disorder the researchers said.|
Thu Jul 07 16:37:06 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/zgUsiXPX7X, | Chocolate Recipes to Die(t) For|, |['chocolate' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'anti-oxidants'] |, |Is chocolate the answer to bad moods high stress and broken hearts? Maybe not but lots of women feel it comes pretty darn close. A world without chocolate would be a pretty tasteless place.Chocolate is the superstar of food cravings: 68% of women's food cravings are for chocolate. (I can tell you that I for one am somewhere in that 68%.) And the time we crave it the most? Apparently it's an afternoon delight. Don't even try to get between a woman in need and a candy bar machine around 3 o'clock! A recent review study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association said that "chocolate cravings are real." Any woman in the midst of PMS could have told them that! And ignoring those cravings may not be such a good idea. A recent study on normal-weight women published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders suggested that forbidding chocolate only leads to greater temptation -- and greater chocolate consumption. For many "comfort" is synonymous with chocolate. Some of the top-rated comfort foods? Try chocolate cookies chocolate cake brownies and chocolate ice cream. It's no coincidence that both versions of the "Better Than Sex Cake" recipes that made their way across America several years ago featured chocolate. No food tantalizes the taste buds quite like chocolate. It represents a divine blend of more than 500 flavors (2 1/2 times more flavors than any other food!) And no other food has its sensual depth -- even its melting point is sensual: Chocolate melts almost immediately in response to human touch because its melting point is just below body temperature. Couple that with chocolate's other appealing characteristics -- like the blend of fat and sugar the smooth texture and arousing aroma -- and you've got quite possibly the most alluring food on the planet! But our attraction to chocolate goes even further than that. There may be a hormonal link to chocolate cravings as they often come and go with the monthly hormonal fluctuations and mood swings of women. There also happen to be several biologically active substances in chocolate (methylxanthines biogenic amines cannabinoid-like fatty acids) that may cause psychological sensations similar to addictive substances according to a study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. Here's the best news of all: Chocolate may actually be good for you (at least in the form of cocoa). Cocoa beat out red wine and green and black tea as having the highest levels of heart-healthy antioxidant activity according to a recent study. The researchers also noted that cocoa had much higher levels of two phytochemicals (total phenolics and flavonoids) than the wine or tea. The flavonoids found in cocoa are thought to benefit the heart in a couple of ways including possible antioxidant protection.|

But we have quite a ways to go in recognizing what it looks like – and stripping away the shame attached to mental health conditions says Rory Brosius. Brosius is deputy director of Joining Forces an initiative launched in 2011 by first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden wife of Vice President Joe Biden to help military personnel transition to civilian life. Brosius’ mission is to promote wellness in that population and beyond — service members veterans and civilians. She’s broadening that conversation through Campaign to Change Direction an initiative begun last spring that hopes to change the culture of mental health in the U.S. The campaign helps raise awareness of five key signs of emotional suffering. “We’ve treated mental health somehow different than our physical health but it’s part of our holistic wellness” says Brosius a social worker by training and the wife of Matthew Brosius a Marine who is re-entering civilian life. WebMD talked to Brosius 33 about the campaign and the work she’s doing to promote psychological wellness both among service personnel and their families and the general public. Q. What are the 5 signs that someone may be suffering from a mental health issue? A. The key part is educating people on these five signs: personality change withdrawal agitation poor self-care and hopelessness. They’re signs somebody may be suffering. If you see them you can reach out and help them. Because there is support that is available. Q: What are some misperceptions people have about mental illness?  A: There are quite a few like people with mental illness are violent or somehow unpredictable when the reality is that people with mental illness are 10 times likelier to be victims of a violent crime. We have stereotypical ideas of what it means to live with a mental health issue. Another one is that people assume they don’t know anyone with mental illness but 1 in 5 American adults has dealt with a mental health issue in their life. You look around a room someone’s dealing with it someone’s in recovery. You may not notice it. Q: If the signs of mental illness are subtle how do you make ordinary people aware of them? A: It’s not so easy to detect because it’s something we don’t talk about. [But] there are things you notice that indicate that somebody’s in pain. Forty years ago people didn’t know how to recognize a heart attack; through education we learned how to read the signs. This is a sticky and hard issue for people to talk about …it will take time but we’ve seen the same thing with heart disease and stroke and breast cancer — it’s a matter of education. Q: What is the best way to support someone with mental health issues?  A: There are great ways to support somebody suffering just by being empathetic being a good friend listening you can learn a lot about mental health. There are great resources – mentalhealth.gov National Alliance for Mental Health – their whole mission is to teach people what to look for. In the age of the internet and Google we have the ability to access that information at our fingertips. But really just being there. Maybe the person would like you to go to an appointment with them or spend time with you. Q: Is there a different approach we might take with a service member than with a civilian? A: In the same way you’d listen to a civilian you would do with a service member. One benefit in that population is we have specialized resources geared to service members and their families. There is support for military personnel and their families peer-to-peer services warm handoff programs to service members transitioning to civilian life. There are distinct benefits to being a service member. Q: You have written that mental health is a human issue not a military issue. Can you elaborate? One in 5 American adults has experienced a mental health issue. In the military people are suffering from mental health issues just like across the population.

In a study of over 7 million people Danish researchers found that those who'd been hospitalized for infections were 42 percent more likely to die of suicide compared to people with no history of serious infection. People hospitalized for HIV/AIDS or the liver infection hepatitis showed the highest risk -- more than twice that of people without those diseases the study found. Although the study couldn't prove a cause-and-effect link the study authors and at least one other brain health expert think the increased risk of suicide after infection might not simply reflect the psychological impact of serious illness. Instead infections might directly contribute to suicide risk by causing inflammation in the brain.  "We know that inflammation can cause depression symptoms" said Dr. Lena Brundin. She's an associate professor at the Van Andel Research Institute's Center for Neurodegenerative Science in Grand Rapids Mich. That she said is based on evidence from both animals and humans. For example the drug interferon revs up the immune system's inflammatory response and up to 45 percent of patients develop depression during treatment according to Brundin. Interferon is used to treat certain infections and some cancers according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The new study is important in part because it's huge according to Brundin. She said it strengthens the case that smaller studies have made: Depression and suicidal behavior may be inflammatory disorders to some degree. Brundin wrote an editorial published with the findings Aug. 10 in JAMA Psychiatry. For the study researchers used Denmark's system of national registries to comb through data on over 7 million people who lived in the country between 1980 and 2011. During that time over 800000 -- or 11 percent -- were hospitalized for an infection including HIV hepatitis or infections of the lungs digestive system skin or blood. Based on death certificates nearly 32700 people died of suicide during the 32-year study period. Almost one-quarter of them had ever been hospitalized for an infection the study showed.|

These taxes are seen by some as one way to combat the obesity epidemic in the United States because it's believed price increases would discourage people from buying the products. On Nov. 8 the California cities of Albany Oakland and San Francisco as well as Boulder Colo. will be voting on whether to institute soda taxes. In the study researchers analyzed the effect of a soda tax implemented in Berkeley Calif. in early 2015. It requires soda distributors to pay the city 1 cent per ounce whenever they deliver soda to a store which works out to an extra 20 cents for a 20-ounce bottle and $1.44 for a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans. But the prices paid by consumers rose by only 43 percent of the tax. However "the limited price increase resulting from the tax should not be seen as a failure but as evidence that consumers are responding to the policy" said study author John Cawley. He is a professor of policy analysis and management and of economics at Cornell University in Ithaca N.Y. The tax in Berkeley was the country's first on sugar-sweetened beverages for public health purposes. In the study the researchers also found that the closer a store was to an untaxed rival outside of Berkeley the less it passed the taxes on to consumers. "Our research suggests that these taxes may be only partially passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices" Cawley said in a university news release. Because consumers are sensitive to price suppliers don't want to shift all of the tax to consumers he explained. The study was published recently in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management.|

The researchers reviewed prior studies examining the link between diabetes and hearing loss. However further research is needed to confirm this connection said the team at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in New York City. "An association between diabetes and hearing impairment in human subjects has been shown in many but not all studies" said Elizabeth Helzner an assistant professor in the School of Public Health. "Direct comparison of these studies is complicated due to a lack of consistency in defining hearing impairment and other factors" she said in a SUNY news release.  However Helzner added the association between diabetes and hearing impairment tends to be stronger in studies that included younger participants. It's possible that in older patients other causes of age-related hearing impairment may mask the contribution of diabetes she said. "This factor in itself lends weight to the notion that type 2 diabetes can damage hearing" she explained.  Hearing loss affects more than 16 percent of American adults with nearly half of people older than 75 having difficulty hearing according to the U.S. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.  Hearing loss has been linked with social isolation depression mental decline dementia and increased risk for falls hospitalization and death the researchers say. The study results were published recently in the journal Current Diabetes Reports.|

The flu shot also appeared to protect those with type 2 diabetes from hospitalizations for stroke as well as heart and breathing problems the study said. British researchers looked at a large group -- more than 124500 people -- with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes normally have a higher risk of cardiovascular problems the researchers noted. During the seven-year study the researchers found that flu vaccination was associated with a 19 percent reduction in flu-season hospital admissions for heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. Hospital admissions for stroke were 30 percent lower for those who got a flu vaccination. Admissions were also down 22 percent for heart failure and 15 percent for pneumonia or influenza in people with type 2 diabetes who got the flu shot. The death rate among those who received a flu shot was 24 percent lower than in those who weren't vaccinated the research said. The study wasn't designed to prove a cause-and-effect link between the flu shot and the reduction in death and hospital admissions. However the study did show a strong connection between those factors. The results show "that people with type 2 diabetes may derive substantial benefits from current vaccines including protection against hospital admission for some major cardiovascular outcomes" wrote study researcher Dr. Eszter Vamos from Imperial College London and colleagues. "These findings underline the importance of influenza vaccination as part of comprehensive secondary prevention in this high-risk population" the researchers said.

Instead simpler measures that include your age and your ability to climb stairs or walk a short distance may more accurately pinpoint longevity researchers report. The study team analyzed death rates over five years among older people in the United States (60 and older) Costa Rica (61 and older) and Taiwan (53 and older).  The aim was to find out how a broad set of basic measures -- such as age mobility and smoking habits -- compared with gauging the length of telomeres in predicting death over a five-year period. Telomeres are the ends of DNA that shrink with age the researchers said. Since the discovery that telomeres act as a "molecular clock" in people there has been great interest in finding out if telomere length can be used to accurately predict when someone will die the scientists explained. But this new study found that using telomere length was just slightly better than a "coin toss" the researchers said. Actual age was by far the single best predictor of death according to the findings published online April 6 in the journal PLoS One. "Scientific evidence on telomere length has been sensationalized and in some cases exaggerated by the media and by companies that have capitalized on the research to market products that may promise more than they can deliver" said study author Dana Glei. She is a senior research investigator at Georgetown University's Center for Population and Health in Washington D.C. Study co-author Noreen Goldman is a professor of demography and public affairs at Princeton University. She said in a Princeton news release "We were surprised that most indicators outperformed telomere length including self-reported measures of health and mobility an assessment of cognitive [mental] function smoking exercise an inflammatory marker and a measure of kidney function." The findings show there is no evidence to suggest that doctors should test telomere length to determine how long patients will live the study authors said. "It is much easier and less expensive to ask someone's age than to collect blood extract DNA and measure telomere length" Glei said in the news release. The study results are also important for consumers the researchers said. "On the Internet they sell test-your-own-telomere-length kits and supplements that are touted to help people maintain their telomeres. We caution buyers to beware" Glei added.|

The mosquito-borne virus is already suspected of causing a birth defect called microcephaly -- characterized by an abnormally small head and brain -- and a nervous system disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome. Now a new study reports a possible link between Zika and an autoimmune disorder known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). In this disease the immune system attacks the coating (myelin) around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord much like multiple sclerosis. "Though our study is small it may provide evidence that in this case the virus has different effects on the brain than those identified in current studies" said study author Dr. Maria Lucia Brito Ferreira of Restoration Hospital Recife Brazil. The study results released April 10 will be presented April 15 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Vancouver Canada. Research presented at meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. "Much more research will need to be done to explore whether there is a causal link between Zika and these brain problems" Ferreira added in an academy news release. In Guillain-Barre the immune system attacks the nervous system resulting in muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Zika which is prevalent in Latin America and the Caribbean is mainly transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes aegyptimosquitoes. Most healthy people infected with the virus experience no symptoms but babies whose mothers were exposed to the virus in pregnancy appear to be at special risk for microcephaly. The new research indicates the virus might have implications for others as well. The new study focused on six people who developed neurologic symptoms after arriving at a hospital in Recife between December 2014 and June 2015. All reported symptoms consistent with the family of viruses that includes Zika dengue and chikungunya. These symptoms included fever followed by a rash and in some cases severe itching muscle and joint pain and red eyes.|

The researchers said the findings may shed light on reports -- though controversial -- of perceived declines in the fertility of men in a number of countries including the United States the United Kingdom and France. "This is the first time that such a decline in male fertility has been reported in the dog and we believe this is due to environmental contaminants some of which we have detected in dog food and in the sperm and testes of the animals themselves" said study leader Richard Lea. He's with the University of Nottingham School of Veterinary Medicine and Science. Several reviews of human male fertility have reported a decline in sperm quality over the last 70 years and an increase in reproductive problems such as undescended testicles according to background information in the new study. But because different labs used different methods over the years there's still debate over the significance of these findings. Still the authors of the dog study said the previous studies on men suggest that an adverse environment is having an impact on men's reproductive systems. And the adverse exposure is thought to happen early in a man's life the researchers said. Since dogs and men share similar environments and similar reproductive systems the researchers thought studying dogs might help provide some answers. The study investigators looked at 26 years of samples taken from five breeds of stud dogs at a dog breeding center in the United Kingdom. These breeds included Labrador retriever golden retriever curly coat retriever border collie and German shepherd. Sperm samples were taken annually from between 42 and 97 dogs the study authors said. The researchers said they found a significant decrease in the dogs' sperm quality during the study period. They also said they found that the dogs' sperm and testes had levels of chemical pollutants that can harm sperm. These chemicals were also found in some pet foods including brands marketed for puppies the study authors said.|

Bertrand Jordan a molecular biologist in France analyzed more than 60 years of medical research on about 177000 survivors and their children as well as 20000 people who were not exposed to radiation from the bombs. The United States dropped the bombs in August 1945 and 200000 people died in the immediate aftermath. Survivors did have a 10 percent to 44 percent added risk of cancer due to radiation exposure from the bombs. But they lived only a few months less on average than those not exposed to radiation the study findings said. No health effects or radiation-associated mutations have been detected in children of survivors according to the findings published in the August issue of the journal Genetics. Although more detailed tests might one day reveal subtle differences among survivors' children Jordan claimed the risk to their health risk isn't as great as feared.  "Most people including many scientists are under the impression that the survivors faced debilitating health effects and very high rates of cancer and that their children had high rates of genetic disease. There's an enormous gap between that belief and what has actually been found by researchers" Jordan said in a journal news release. There are several possible explanations for the study findings including historical context Jordan said. "People are always more afraid of new dangers than familiar ones" Jordan said. "For example people tend to disregard the dangers of coal both to people who mine it and to the public exposed to atmospheric pollution. Radiation is also much easier to detect than many chemical hazards. With a hand-held geiger counter you can sensitively detect tiny amounts of radiation that pose no health risk at all." But Jordan said his findings should not cause complacency about the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents. The meltdowns that occurred in 2011 at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima Japan after an earthquake triggered a massive tsunami shows that disasters can occur even in a country like Japan that has strict regulations governing the nuclear industry he said.|
Thu Sep 08 09:36:31 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/PZdPyh4X5Y, | Cord-Blood Transplants Show Promise for Leukemia|, |['cord blood' 'cord blood transplant' 'donor' 'recipient' 'leukemia' 'treating leukemia' 'leukemia treatments'] |, |WEDNESDAY Sept. 7 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Bone marrow or stem cell transplants can save the lives of adults and children with leukemia but an ideal donor often isn't available. In those cases umbilical cord blood may work as well as current alternatives -- or even better in some cases a new study suggests. "Often cord-blood transplant is thought to be only as the last resource for patients without donors. But cord blood does not have to be considered only an alternative donor source" said study lead author Dr. Filippo Milano. "In centers with experience it can yield to great outcomes" said Milano an assistant member of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. At issue: How best to treat the blood cancer leukemia and a related condition called myelodysplastic syndrome? One approach replaces a patient's blood-producing bone marrow through a transplant. The "gold standard" is to find a relative who can donate bone marrow or stem cells preferably a "matched" sibling whose blood is compatible with the patient's Milano said. But for 70 percent of patients this ideal fit doesn't occur the study authors noted. Physicians then might recommend a transplant from a compatible donor unrelated to the patient or an unrelated donor who's mostly (but not entirely) compatible.  This new study considers another option: A donation of cord blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of newborn babies. Like bone marrow or stem cell transplants a cord-blood transplant can produce stem cells that create new blood. "However cord-blood donors and recipients don't need to be a perfect match" Milano said.  To compare the success of the different options researchers looked at 582 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. If a compatible bone marrow or stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor wasn't available the patients got either a cord-blood transplant or an incompatible bone marrow or stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor Milano said. "Our study showed that overall survival after cord-blood transplantation was comparable to the one observed after matched unrelated transplants" Milano said. And patients who got cord-blood transplants seemed to live longer than those who got non-matching bone marrow or stem cell transplants from unrelated donors he noted.|
Tue Jun 28 11:57:10 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/btnkhORD11, | Old Drug Boosts Brain's Memory Centers|, |['Methylene blue' 'memory loss' 'short term memory' 'methemoglobinemia' 'cyanide poisoning poisonoing'] |, |TUESDAY June 28 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A long-used drug called methylene blue may rev up activity in brain regions involved in short-term memory and attention a small study suggests. Methylene blue has been used in medicine for more than a century said Timothy Duong the senior researcher on the study and a professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. These days he said it's used to manage a condition called methemoglobinemia where the blood cannot deliver enough oxygen to the body's tissues. It's also used to treat poisoning by cyanide or carbon monoxide. But evidence dating back to the 1970s suggests the drug may also enhance memory in animals and humans Duong said. In the new study his team found that a single dose of methylene blue improved memory test performances by 13 healthy adults in a small placebo-based clinical trial. Based on MRI brain scans the medication worked by stimulating brain structures involved in processing memories as well as visual and sensory information. Methylene blue is readily available and cheap Duong said. But at this point no one is suggesting it's ready to be used for preventing or treating memory decline. "Clearly this is early research" said Dr. Ezriel Kornel an assistant clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. For one it's not known whether the drug's effects diminish over repeated doses said Kornel who wasn't involved in the study. What's more he said the study included only people with intact memories and not those with impairments. Still Kornel called the findings "fascinating." He said larger longer-term studies should dig deeper into the drug's potential. According to Duong methylene blue acts as "an antioxidant and an energy enhancer." In simple terms it can allow brain cells to receive more energy. While there was already evidence that methylene blue can boost short-term memory Duong said his team wanted to know how the drug affects the brain. To do that the researchers used functional MRI which tracks blood flow in the brain as a person performs mental tasks.|

In an online search researchers found at least 570 clinics offering unapproved stem cell "therapies." They tend to be concentrated in a handful of states -- including Arizona California Colorado Florida New York and Texas -- but are scattered across many other states too. Most often the clinics market stem cell procedures for orthopedic conditions such as arthritis and injured ligaments and tendons. This does have science behind it but is still experimental medical experts said. In other cases with little or no supporting evidence clinics hawked stem cell "facelifts" and therapies for serious conditions such as chronic lung disease Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. If these pricey stem cell treatments are unproven and unapproved by federal regulators how can these clinics exist? "I ask myself that question all the time" said Leigh Turner a bioethicist who worked on the study. Turner an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics said attention used to focus on "stem cell tourism" -- where people travel to countries such as China India and Mexico to get unproven treatments. "I think there's a misperception that everything here [in the U.S.] is regulated" Turner said. "But these clinics are operating here and on a relatively large scale." Stem cells are primitive cells with the potential to mature into various types of body tissue. Medical researchers have been studying the possibility of using stem cells to repair damaged tissue in a range of chronic ills -- with limited success so far. But the general public has heard about the "promise" of stem cells for years and it can be easy to be taken in by clinics' marketing tactics Turner said. Websites can for instance link to published medical studies that make their therapies seem legitimate Turner said. "These businesses can be quite savvy" he said. "I think it's asking too much to just tell consumers to be wary. We need to be asking why should these clinics be allowed to do this?"|

A team of Swedish and American researchers said levels of certain protein "markers" in newborns' blood seemed to predict which children would go on to develop an autism spectrum disorder. This is "important evidence that the immune system in early life may be a key determinant of later risk of autism spectrum disorders" wrote the team led by Dr. R. M. Gardner of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. The researchers examined blood from nearly 900 children who developed some form of autism. The children were born in Sweden between 1998 and 2000. The researchers compared those blood samples to blood from more than 1100 kids who didn't develop the disorder. While the study can't prove cause-and-effect babies who went on to develop autism had higher blood levels of certain proteins that signaled inflammation the researchers said. However there's not yet enough evidence "to use such a profile to precisely predict which children would go on to develop [autism]" Gardner's team stressed. Still the researchers said the new finding supports previous observations that infection during pregnancy and other conditions that can lead to increased inflammation have been linked to a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders.  Two experts said the findings were intriguing. But they added that much more research is needed. "This study probably presents more questions than it answers" said Dr. Victoria Chen of Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park N.Y. "There is not much known about what causes neonatal inflammation to increase or decrease in general" explained Chen an attending physician in the hospital's division of developmental behavioral pediatrics. "Overall this is an exciting finding" she said "but there needs to be more work done to understand whether these proteins have a causal role -- and what role it plays in the development of autism spectrum disorder." Alycia Halladay is chief science officer with the Autism Science Foundation. She agreed that while the findings are interesting only more research will show if spotting and lowering inflammation in pregnancy might "mitigate the risk of autism spectrum disorders." The study was slated for presentation Wednesday in Baltimore at the International Meeting for Autism Research. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.|

The condition is called limber tail and mostly affects larger working breeds such as Labrador retrievers the researchers said. The research team compared 38 dogs with limber tail and 86 dogs without it. Working dogs were more likely than pets to be affected as were dogs in northern areas supporting a belief that the disorder may be related to exposure to cold. Labrador retrievers with limber tail were more likely to have family members with the condition than unaffected dogs which suggests a genetic risk. Some of the dogs with limber tail had been swimming before developing symptoms according to the study published recently in the journal Veterinary Record. "We have been able to add evidence to a lot of Internet speculation about risk factors and the new findings relating to geographical region and family links give us avenues to pursue in understanding and avoiding the condition" said study leader Carys Pugh. Pugh is a research fellow at the Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh Scotland who made his comments in a university news release. If further research pinpoints genes associated with limber tail it could help breeders identify dogs likely to be affected. Over time this could help curb limber tail cases the researchers said.|
Wed Apr 06 18:49:55 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/HqYMwaNjyZ, | Chemo May Prolong Lives of Some With Brain Cancer|, |['chemo' 'chemotherapy' 'brain cancer' 'cancer'] |, |WEDNESDAY April 6 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Adding chemotherapy to radiation treatment may add years to the lives of people with certain slow-growing brain tumors a new study finds. The findings come from a long-term follow-up of patients who took part in a trial that began in 1998. All were treated for grade 2 gliomas -- tumors that begin in brain cells called glial cells and are relatively slow-growing. Earlier results from the trial had shown that adding chemotherapy to the standard treatment of radiation -- with or without surgery -- can help keep tumors from progressing. Now there's proof that it prolongs people's lives too. "Until now there hasn't been any therapy known to improve life expectancy for these patients" said lead researcher Dr. Jan Buckner. He is the chair of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn. In the United States nearly 23000 adults were diagnosed with brain cancer in 2015 according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). There are many different forms of brain cancer and grade 2 gliomas are relatively rare -- accounting for 5 percent to 10 percent of all adult brain cancers Buckner's team noted. They are also slower-growing. A tumor's "grade" refers to how aggressive it is with grade 3 and 4 brain tumors typically progressing quickly and invading other tissue. But grade 2 gliomas disproportionately affect younger adults and most of those patients do die prematurely according to Buckner. The question had been whether adding chemotherapy to their radiation treatment could extend their lives. The latest study published in the April 7 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine and funded by the NCI recruited 251 patients between 1998 and 2002. Half were randomly assigned to have six weeks of radiation therapy alone while the other half had radiation followed by chemotherapy with a trio of drugs called procarbazine CCNU and vincristine. When possible the participants had some of the cancer surgically removed before undergoing radiation. The patients ranged in age but they were typically about 40 years old.|

The study also found that immediate-release stimulants are more likely to be misused than extended-release versions of the drugs. A previous study found that nearly two-thirds of college students had been offered stimulants for non-medical use and 31 percent had used them over a four-year period. The new Massachusetts General Hospital study included 300 undergraduates between the ages of 18 and 28 at Boston-area campuses. One-third misused stimulant drugs. Misusers were more likely to have been diagnosed with ADHD or to have related symptoms as children such as being easily distracted and having trouble paying attention. As adults they were more likely to have trouble following instructions and to dislike tasks requiring focus. Misusers also were more apt to meet criteria for substance-use disorder -- including use of drugs and alcohol together. Two-thirds met or approached criteria for stimulant-use disorder. They got stimulants from friends or acquaintances were more likely to say they used any drugs to "get high" and had a lower overall sense of well-being. The study was published recently in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. "Our data suggest that college students who misuse prescription stimulant medications are more likely to exhibit clinically relevant psychiatric dysfunction" corresponding author Dr. Timothy Wilens said in a hospital news release. He said not everyone uses these drugs simply to "get high." "Some misusers may be pressured to use a friend's prescription if they believe it will improve academic performance which is not likely if combined with alcohol or other drugs" said Wilens chief of child and adolescent psychiatry and co-director of the hospital's Center for Addiction Medicine. "We know that untreated ADHD is associated with increased risk of alcohol- and drug-use disorders so it is not surprising that we found high rates of co-occurring ADHD and of stimulant-use and overall substance-use disorders in those misusing stimulants" he said.|

The study released Friday by the federal government's National Toxicology Program (NTP) found "low incidences" of two types of tumors in male rats exposed to the type of radio frequencies emitted by cellphones the Wall Street Journal reported. The two types of tumors were glioma brain cancer and benign schwannomas of the heart according to the $25 million study that is one of the largest and most comprehensive to assess the health impacts of cellphones. "Given the widespread global usage of mobile communications among users of all ages even a very small increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to [radio-frequency radiation] could have broad implications for public health" according to an NTP summary of partial findings from the study released late Thursday the WSJ reported. However NIH experts were quick to highlight flaws in the study according to the Associated Press.  For example they pointed out that the study exposed rats to very high levels of cellphone radiation beginning in the womb and then through the first two years of the rats' life. Even then only 2 percent to 3 percent of male rats -- and no females -- developed a tumor.  The fact that none of the female rats developed a tumor is odd the NIH experts said as is the fact that rats who did not get exposed to the radiation died at higher rates than those who did get exposed. The unexposed rats also failed to develop tumors at a rate that would be expected in a "normal" population the NIH experts noted. Based on these findings "I am unable to accept the authors' conclusions" wrote outside reviewer Dr. Michael Lauer deputy director of NIH's office of extramural research. "I suspect that this experiment is substantially underpowered and that the few positive results found reflect false positive findings." He also said that the fact rats exposed to the radiation actually lived longer "leaves me even more skeptical of the authors' claims."|

Women's internal or circadian body clocks run at a faster pace than men's according to the research. It's as if women operate in a different "internal time zone" said study lead author Dr. Diane Boivin professor of psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal. "They go to bed at a later biological time because their clock is shifted earlier eastward" Boivin said. Boivin also directs the Centre for Study and Treatment of Circadian Rhythms at Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Montreal a McGill affiliate. The way women sleep throughout the 24-hour circadian day also outpaces men the study showed. Boivin said these two findings explain why women's sleep-wake cycle runs about two hours ahead of men. Women are more likely than men to report insomnia at least a few days a week and experience daytime sleepiness according to the National Sleep Foundation a U.S.-based nonprofit organization. What makes this new study unique is that the researchers controlled for women's menstrual cycle phases and hormonal contraceptive use. Reported sleep differences occurred regardless of hormonal changes which can affect sleep the study authors said. "Even though the study is small it definitely adds knowledge to our scientific literature on sex differences in sleep in context of circadian rhythm" said Monica Mallampalli vice president of scientific affairs at the Society for Women's Health Research in Washington D.C. Jennifer Martin associate professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles suggested: "Perhaps women are predisposed to having insomnia based on their circadian phase." "In the face of similar stressors women are more likely than men to experience poor sleep as a result" Martin said. The study was reported Sept. 12 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It involved 15 men and 11 women about 25 years old on average.  Over a 36-hour period participants were isolated in a windowless room where researchers controlled their exposure to light and monitored changes in core body temperature melatonin levels sleep and alertness.|

The theory for this trial was that this drug -- from a class of medications called (GLP-1) agonists -- might interact with the heart's GLP-1 receptors on cells and thereby improve heart function. "We were hoping for a benefit; we didn't see that. It's at best neutral" said lead researcher Dr. Kenneth Margulies. He's a professor of medicine and research director of heart failure and transplantation at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Previous studies found evidence that people with advanced heart failure have insulin resistance of their peripheral muscles and heart muscle and "this was felt to be a detrimental feature that this type of diabetes medicine might help" he said. Not only did the drug not help but it's possible that Victoza might have even been slightly harmful in some patients with advanced heart failure Margulies said. The study noted that people with type 2 diabetes who were taking Victoza had a slightly higher though nonsignificant risk of death and rehospitalization as well as signs of worsening kidney function. But patients using Victoza who develop heart failure shouldn't abruptly stop taking it he added. One expert noted that this trial contradicts the findings of another study that found that Victoza lowered the risk of dying from heart disease. "I suspect that [this] trial is not the final word on the issue" said Dr. John Buse. He's the chief and professor of the division of endocrinology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. This new study was small relatively short in duration and statistically complex Buse explained. It also involved treating people with diabetes as well as those without diabetes he added.  "It does not square with the results of the larger longer LEADER trial (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results)" Buse said.  The LEADER trial researchers including Buse found that over nearly four years patients with type 2 diabetes and heart disease who were taking Victoza had a lower risk of death from heart disease and stroke or from any cause compared with placebo.|

Turns out insects also have a taste for lush surroundings researchers report. An examination of insects in 50 Raleigh N.C. homes found richer neighborhoods have a greater diversity of plants which attracts a greater variety of insects.  Even individual homes without many plants in the yard are apt to have high levels of insect diversity in those neighborhoods researchers add. That's likely due to features such as parks and communal landscaping that are often found in wealthier areas as well as neighbors with lush landscaping. The study was published Aug. 3 in the journal Biology Letters. "The sheer amount of life thriving within your home -- under carpet in closets -- is astonishing" lead author Misha Leong a post-doctoral researcher at the California Academy of Sciences said in an academy news release. "Now we're learning that neighborhood affluence was one of the primary predictors for the number of different bug types -- mostly non-pests -- living inside which really surprised me. We hope our findings inspire people to re-imagine the context of their homes and apartments within the larger environment" Leong said. About 100 different types of arthropods (insects and their close relatives) are found inside the average home but most are not pests. "Even though we spend billions of dollars each year to control for cockroaches ticks termites and other infestations there are still a number of overlooked benign species" Leong said. "Don't panic -- most bugs aren't the problem roommates we make them out to be."|

Recognizing this parents need to work with their kids to develop a media use plan for the entire family the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a set of new recommendations unveiled Friday. Some specific suggestions for such a plan include: No screens for kids under 18 months; only one hour of media a day for toddlers; and no use of digital media as a "soothing tool" for kids. In general any media use plan must balance healthy activities like exercise sleep and family time against the use of media devices said Dr. Megan Moreno an associate professor of pediatrics at Seattle Children's Hospital. She is the lead author of the AAP's policy statement on media use in school-aged children and teens. "We're really promoting the idea that every family member needs to prioritize these key health behaviors and then look at the time that's left over and deciding how much of that time should be spent on media and what kinds of media we want to engage in" Moreno said. Media should be limited to one hour a day for children ages 2 to 5 and it should involve high-quality programming that parents and kids can engage with together the statement says. With the exception of video-chatting digital media should be avoided altogether in children younger than 18 months old. Older children and teenagers should have consistent and reasonable limits placed on their media use and parents need to follow similar limits the AAP recommends. "For the first time we also hold parents accountable for the same standards that we hold kids to" Moreno added. "We ask parents to follow the same guidelines. That makes it much more of a family set of guidelines rather than targeting just kids." To help parents the AAP on Friday launched an online Family Media Use Plan tool that will allow them to set limits for every family member.|

A 70-year-old man with Zika died in February from severe thrombocytopenia which causes a low blood platelet count that can lead to internal bleeding. The death was announced by Puerto Rico's health secretary Ana Rius. So far Puerto Rico has had more than 600 Zika cases including 73 involving pregnant women. All 14 women who have given birth so far have had healthy babies the Associated Press reported. Zika can cause severe birth defects. Sixteen of the Zika patients in Puerto Rico have been hospitalized and four are believed to have developed temporary paralysis due to the mosquito-borne virus according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC is urging all residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico to continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites take precautions to reduce the risk of sexual transmission of the virus and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever. While the Zika virus poses little health risk to most people it poses a significant threat to pregnant women because it can cause a birth defect called microcephaly which results in babies born with abnormally small heads and brains. To control the threat posed by Zika officials in Puerto Rico are pursuing "vector control activities" that include indoor and outdoor spraying of insecticides and reducing mosquito breeding grounds especially around pregnant women's homes the CDC said. As of April 27 there were 1025 confirmed cases of Zika in U.S. states and territories according to the CDC. Nearly all of these infections were acquired by people who had traveled outside the United States. As mosquito season approaches U.S. health experts expect to see more infections in Gulf Coast states such as Florida and Texas as well as Hawaii. Meanwhile new research suggests the Zika virus was circulating in Haiti months before the first cases in Brazil -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- were reported last spring.|

Between 1970 and 2010 the average life span for men increased 9.2 years to 76.2 years of age and for women it increased 6.4 years to 81 years of age according to the report. However the number of years lived with a disability rose 4.7 years among men and 3.6 years among women while the number of disability-free years increased by 4.5 years for men and 2.7 years for women the findings showed. "We could be increasing the length of poor-quality life more than good-quality life" said lead author Eileen Crimmins. She is a professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California Davis School of Gerontology. "There are a number of indications that the baby boomer generation that is now reaching old age is not seeing improvements in health similar to the older groups that went before them" she said in a university news release. The investigators found that only those 65 and older experienced what they called a "compression of morbidity" -- a reduction in the proportion of years spent with disability. The findings are important for policy proposals such as raising the age for Social Security and Medicare eligibility the researchers said. "Clearly there is a need to maintain health and reduce disability at younger ages to have meaningful compression of morbidity across the age range" Crimmins said. "The trends for the last 40 years do not support projections and policies that are based on assumptions of a reduced length of disabled life." The study was published online April 14 in the American Journal of Public Health.|

In the study those who endured the nausea and vomiting of morning sickness were 50 percent to 75 percent less likely to experience a pregnancy loss. The review focused on women who'd already lost one or two pregnancies. "This should be reassuring for women experiencing these symptoms which can be very taxing" said lead researcher Stefanie Hinkle. She is a staff scientist at the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda Md. As many as four out of five women report nausea or vomiting during pregnancy the researchers said in background notes. Morning sickness often is cited as a sign of a healthy pregnancy but little is known about it Hinkle and other experts said. For example the exact cause of morning sickness remains elusive and experts are unsure whether it is just a side effect of pregnancy or serves some specific purpose. To test whether morning sickness truly is a positive sign for expecting mothers Hinkle and her colleagues studied 797 women. All were newly pregnant as confirmed by a urine test and enrolled in the study between June 2007 and July 2011. Among the women 188 pregnancies (nearly 24 percent) ended in loss the investigators found. At week two of gestation nearly 18 percent of women reported nausea and about 3 percent reported nausea with vomiting. That discomfort paid off however. Women who experienced nausea were 50 percent less likely to lose their pregnancy and women who had vomiting were 75 percent less likely according to the report. "This sort of assertion has been out there for a long time and our data really provides the most definitive evidence we have for this to date" Hinkle said. But the study did not prove cause and effect.|

So finds data from a 2014 -- the latest year available -- federal government survey of more than 10000 people aged 18 to 22 about 4000 of whom were in college. The poll found that compared to others their age about 60 percent of full-time college students are current drinkers compared to just over half of people their age who aren't in college. About 38 percent of college students said they have had a binge-drinking episode at least once over the past month compared to about one-third of their peers who weren't in college the report found. Binge drinking is defined as having five or more drinks on one occasion. All of this is "important now that many students are starting or returning to college" said Fran Harding who directs the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention at the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) which produced the report. There was an upside to the findings for college kids however: They were less likely than others their age to be current cigarette smokers. About 18 percent of survey respondents in college smoked compared to almost one-third of those who weren't college students. However both groups had similar rates of use of other drugs such as marijuana cocaine crack LSD and heroin the report found. The two groups had different views on the risks of smoking drinking and illicit drug use. Compared to others their age full-time college students were more likely to believe there was great risk of harm from heavy smoking (72.5 percent versus about 63 percent) and with daily binge drinking (about 64 percent versus 55 percent). However full-time college students were less likely than others their age to believe there was great risk of harm from monthly cocaine use (59 percent versus 64 percent) trying heroin once or twice (about 77 percent versus 80 percent) and trying LSD once or twice (about 50 percent versus 58 percent) the findings showed. Both groups had similar perceptions of great risk of harm from weekly marijuana use or weekly binge drinking the survey found. The new data might help inform efforts to curb substance abuse among young adults "so that we can better target prevention programming to young adults from all walks of life with vital information on substance use disorder prevention and treatment" Harding said in a SAMHSA news release.|

In 2014 Colorado and Washington became the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana. Shortly after a sharp increase occurred in the number of Colorado kids younger than 10 who fell ill after being exposed to pot researchers found. Edible products -- cannabis-laced brownies cookies candy and the like -- were responsible for about half of these cases said senior study author Dr. Genie Roosevelt a pediatric emergency medicine specialist with the Denver Health and Hospital Authority. "Edible marijuana products look very much like a regular food product and so they're very attractive to kids because it's candy and baked goods and also very palatable" Roosevelt said. The average rate of marijuana-related visits to Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora nearly doubled following legalization. The rate two years after legalization was 2.3 children per 100000 population compared with 1.2 per 100000 population two years prior to legalization the study found. The regional Poison Control Center that serves Colorado also saw a more than fivefold increase in reported cases of children made ill from marijuana -- from nine in 2009 to 47 last year the researchers said. And the average increase in calls to poison centers statewide was nearly twice that of the rest of the country. Most kids became very sleepy after their exposure to marijuana or experienced a loss of balance or coordination Roosevelt said. But Roosevelt added "we have seen some very sick children who have been put on a ventilator and admitted to the ICU. It sedates them so much that it interferes with their ability to breathe." Parents were the most frequent source of the pot the investigators found along with grandparents neighbors friends babysitters and other family members. People have become more careless in how they store their marijuana following legalization of recreational use said Dr. J. Michael Bostwick. He is chair of consultation and hospital practice for the Mayo Clinic psychiatry and psychology department in Rochester Minn.|

Dog walking helps cut back on excess weight and the overall need to visit a physician while raising overall moderate and vigorous exercise levels among the over-60 set investigators found. And the strong emotional bonds formed between owner and pet offer social benefits encouraging increased contact with other pet owners. "There is a wealth of evidence that walking is beneficial for people's physical health" said study lead author Angela Curl. She is an assistant professor in the department of family studies and social work at Miami University in Oxford Ohio. "[And] what makes dog walking unique is the relationship between people and their dogs as well as the ways dogs can motivate walking behavior" she added. "Other studies have shown dogs' needs provide a motivation to get out and walk. Our findings illustrate that the emotional bond people have with their dogs may play an important role in getting out to walk." Curl and her colleagues discussed their work in a recent issue of The Gerontologist. The authors noted that in 2014 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all adults regardless of age rack up a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate activity every week. Walking happens to be the most frequent exercise activity among adults 60 and up. To explore the impact of dog ownership on that the investigating team analyzed data involving a nationally representative sample of 771 men and women (50 years old and up) collected in 2012 by the Health and Retirement Study. That investigation was conducted at the University of Michigan with funding from the U.S. National Institute on Aging. Just over a third of the participants (271) owned at least one dog. Pet ownership involving other types of animals was not considered. A portion of the dog owners group was asked questions to gauge pet "bonding" including whether they considered their dog a friend and whether they talked about their dog with others.|

Conversely women who drink more alcohol over time might increase their breast cancer risk although they could also lower their chances of heart disease a second report found. In the fruit study consumption of apples bananas and grapes during adolescence was strongly associated with a drop in breast cancer risk. Roughly three daily servings of such fruits was linked to a 25 percent drop in risk by middle age compared with consuming just a half-serving per day. Women who ate oranges and/or kale as young adults also seemed to gain some protection from breast cancer the investigators noted. But drinking fruit juice did not appear to confer any benefit. "This is the first study that specifically shows that high fruit intake during adolescence may be linked with reduced breast cancer risk" said study author Maryam Farvid. She is a research associate in the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Still Farvid cautioned that "due to the observational nature of the study we could not provide evidence of cause and effect" only an association between fruit consumption and a drop in breast cancer risk. In the study the researchers analyzed food questionnaires completed in 1991 by just over 90000 women -- aged 27 to 44 -- who had enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II two years earlier. That survey focused on diets during early adulthood. In 1998 more than 44000 of the women completed a second food survey. That survey asked participants to recall what food they had consumed during adolescence. Food and drink consumption was also tallied once every four years from 1991 to 2013 at which point the women were asked to recall their diets over the prior year. Breast cancer status was tracked every two years. Over the two decades of the study more than 3200 women developed invasive breast cancer. Adolescent dietary information was available for about 1350 of those women.|

As more fentanyl was sold illegally on the streets the number of fatal overdoses jumped 79 percent in 27 states from 2013 to 2014 the government report found while law enforcement seizures of the drug increased 426 percent in eight of those 27 states. "Fentanyl is a powerful opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and it is available by prescription but evidence indicates that illicitly made fentanyl is more likely a powder mixed with heroin and or sold as heroin" said report author R. Matthew Gladden. He's a behavioral scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The fentanyl crisis is being driven by products made illegally not by the diversion of prescription fentanyl Gladden noted. Recently the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reported that synthetic fentanyl was showing up mixed with prescription narcotic painkillers and "this is a new and emerging threat" Gladden said. Most of the victims of these overdoses were men and those aged 15 to 44 the researchers reported. Eight states from the 27 studied were more dramatically affected than the others: Massachusetts Maine New Hampshire Ohio Florida Kentucky Maryland and North Carolina. In those states the synthetic opioid death rate (mostly fentanyl) jumped 174 percent during 2013-2014 the researchers said. In addition seven states reported an increase of more than 100 deaths in 2013-2014 tied to synthetic opioids (mostly fentanyl) the authors said. The report was published Aug. 26 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. "The sharp increase in overdose deaths indicates a need for an urgent response not just in the states that are currently impacted but in other states because the problem seems to be spreading and taking on new dimensions" Gladden said. For example heroin spiked with fentanyl may be responsible for 75 overdoses in Indiana and Ohio since last Friday. More than 30 overdoses occurred in Cincinnati last weekend with 33 more overdoses -- including one death -- in the city since Tuesday. Authorities responded to 14 overdoses -- including one death -- late Tuesday and early Wednesday in Jennings County Ind. USA Today reported.|

One in four high school students now uses what officials define as a tobacco product. And e-cigarettes have eclipsed traditional cigarettes as the most widely used tobacco product among teens according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "E-cigarettes are now the most commonly used tobacco product among youth and use continues to climb" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said Thursday in an agency news release. "No form of youth tobacco use is safe. Nicotine is an addictive drug and use during adolescence may cause lasting harm to brain development." Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat nicotine and flavorings to create a vapor that is inhaled by the user. Last year 4.7 million middle and high school students said they used a tobacco product at least once in the previous 30 days and more than 2.3 million used two or more tobacco products. Three million middle and high school students used e-cigarettes in 2015 up from 2.5 million in 2014 according to data from the 2015 U.S. National Youth Tobacco Survey. Last year 16 percent of high school and 5.3 percent of middle school students were users of e-cigarettes making the devices the most widely used tobacco product among young people for the second straight year federal officials said. From 2011 to 2015 e-cigarette use rose from 1.5 to 16 percent among high school students and from 0.6 percent to 5.3 percent among middle school students according to the study. While there was a significant drop in cigarette smoking between 2011 and 2015 there was no change between 2014 and 2015 the report found. Last year just over 9 percent of high school students and slightly over 2 percent of middle school students smoked cigarettes making them the second most widely used tobacco product among youth.|

Tuesday the agency approved Erelzi (etanercept-szzs) a "biosimilar" to Enbrel. The FDA says the two medications work the same way and are both safe and effective. The industry stops short of calling this a generic version of Enbrel however because the two drugs have minor differences that keep them from being considered exactly the same. Enbrel is one of the most widely used biologics on the market. It was approved in 1998 to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and earned more than $5 billion in sales last year. But the high price tag of Enbrel and other biologics make them too expensive for many people -- sometimes $3000 or more a month. But patients may have to wait for those cost savings from Erelzi a bit longer. Legal wrangling could delay its release so it’s unclear when it may be available. Here is some more information about Erelzi: Erelzi is given by injection. It can be used to treat the same diseases as Enbrel. That includes: With diseases like RA your body makes too much of a protein called tumor necrosis factor or TNF. That causes inflammation joint swelling and pain. Erelzi and Enbrel block the effects of the protein lowering inflammation and pain. That can stop joint damage and in some cases even reverse it.|

Fluconazole (brand name Diflucan) is used to treat vaginal yeast infections.  "Patients who are pregnant or actively trying to get pregnant should talk to their health care professionals about alternative treatment options for yeast infections" the FDA advised Tuesday. The agency said it is evaluating the results of a recent Danish study that suggested a link between fluconazole and miscarriage along with additional data and will release final conclusions and recommendations when the review is completed. Current labeling information suggests that a single 150 milligram (mg) dose of oral fluconazole to treat vaginal yeast infection is safe to take during pregnancy. However the FDA noted that in rare cases higher doses taken during pregnancy (400 mg to 800 mg a day) had been linked to abnormalities at birth. In the Danish study most of the fluconazole use appeared to be one or two doses of 150 mg. "Until FDA's review is complete and more is understood about this study and other available data FDA advises cautious prescribing of oral fluconazole in pregnancy" the agency said in a news release. The agency noted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends only antifungal creams to treat pregnant women with vaginal yeast infections -- even for longer periods than usual if the infections persist or recur. While the Danish study showed that pregnant women treated with fluconazole had a greater risk of miscarriage than those who used an antifungal cream it did not prove the drug causes miscarriages the authors noted. Still "women who are trying to become pregnant or who are pregnant should avoid fluconazole" said Dr. Jennifer Wu an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City when the Danish study results came out. "For these women a topical medicine is the preferred treatment." Fluconazole (available as a pill or suspension liquid) is the only oral drug used to treat yeast infections during pregnancy Wu said.|

The research included 32 young men who hadn't been diagnosed with ADHD but reported high levels of symptoms of the disorder. When the study volunteers completed a 20-minute session of leg cycling exercise they reported lowered feelings of confusion fatigue and depression before performing a mental task.  While activity didn't seem to affect behavior symptoms such as attention or hyperactivity the study authors said the research indicates exercise might help those with the disorder to function better. "There is now evidence that young adult men with symptoms of ADHD who engage in a single bout of moderate-intensity exercise are likely to benefit psychologically" said study author Patrick O'Connor. He's a professor of kinesiology and co-director of the University of Georgia's Exercise Psychology Laboratory. O'Connor said it's possible that exercise causes changes in neurotransmitters in the brain that help improve symptoms right after activity. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that can affect the behavior of cells in the brain according to the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. An estimated 6 percent of adults in the United States who didn't have childhood ADHD are affected by the condition the study authors said. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention impulsivity and excessive fidgeting or movement. ADHD can also lead to low motivation and energy poor performance at work and missed work days. Study participants were between 18 and 33 years old. They all reported symptoms consistent with adult ADHD. On one day the researchers asked the volunteers to cycle at a moderate intensity for 20 minutes. Another day the researchers asked the volunteers to sit and rest for 20 minutes as a comparison condition. Participants were asked to perform a mental task requiring focus before and after both scenarios. During this task researchers measured factors such as leg movement (a sign of hyperactivity) mood attention and self-reported motivation to undertake the task.|

The man's severely damaged esophagus was reconstructed using commercially available metal stents and donated skin tissue. The stents -- approved in the United States to help esophageal cancer patients with a throat obstruction to swallow -- provided a scaffold for the tissue to grow on. "This is a first in human operation and one that we undertook as a lifesaving measure once we had exhausted all other options available to us and the patient" said study author Dr. Kulwinder Dua. He is a professor in the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. The stents were removed four years ago according to the study published April 8 in The Lancet. "The approach we used is novel because we used commercially available products which are already approved for use in the human body and hence didn't require complex tissue engineering" Dua explained in a journal news release. Initially the 24-year-old man had a life-threatening infection and couldn't swallow because of complications from an earlier car crash that left him partially paralyzed. The patient had a nearly 2-inch defect in his esophagus that was too large to repair with conventional surgery despite several attempts. Previously the tissue regeneration technique had only been tested in animals. Further research in animals and people is needed to determine if this method can be repeated and used in similar cases Dua said. The medical team had planned to remove the stents 12 weeks after reconstruction surgery. But the patient put off removal for three-and-a-half years due to fears about possible narrowing or leakage in his esophagus according to the report. One year after the stents were removed endoscopy showed scarring and regeneration of all five layers of the esophagus wall. In addition swallowing tests showed the esophagus muscles were functioning normally. However it's not known how long the regeneration process actually took because of the delay in stent removal the researchers said.|

"The Red Cross continues to have an emergency need for blood and platelet donors to give now and help save patient lives" Nick Gehrig communications director for Red Cross Blood Services said in a news release. The organization noted it first alerted Americans to the need for blood and platelet donations back in early July. And while donation levels did rise "a critical blood shortage remains" the group said. "At times blood and platelets are being distributed to hospitals faster than donations are coming in which impacts the ability to rebuild the blood supply" the Red Cross explained. Right now the national supply has dipped below the five-day level the Red Cross says it needs to make sure it's ready for unforeseen emergencies. "We are grateful for those who have already stepped up this summer to give and want to remind those who are eligible that hospital patients are still counting on them to roll up a sleeve" Gehrig said. All blood types are needed and the Red Cross is even offering donors an incentive in this blood drive. All those who donate by Aug. 31 will receive a $5 Amazon gift card claim code emailed to them after their donation. To schedule an appointment to donate head to redcrossblood.org or call 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767). Donated blood can save lives. Just ask Ray Poulin whose liver and kidneys failed after a severe blood infection. Given only a one in 10 chance of survival he received 77 units of blood -- and lived. "There was a lot that went into saving my life but if the blood wasn't available when I needed it I wouldn't be here today" Poulin said in the Red Cross news release.|

Eczema which causes dry red patches of skin and intense itchiness affects an estimated one-quarter of children in the United States. And as many as seven million adults also have eczema Dr. Jonathan Silverberg said in an American Academy of Dermatology news release. "Although it affects the skin eczema is not just skin-deep. This disease can have a serious impact on patients' quality of life and overall health both physically and mentally" Silverberg said. He's assistant professor in dermatology medical social sciences and preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Eczema has been linked to an increased risk of health conditions such as asthma hay fever food allergy obesity and heart disease Silverberg said. The reasons for this are unclear. But the connection may be eczema-related inflammation affecting the entire body he said. Or the negative effects of eczema symptoms on sleep and health habits may play a role he added. People with eczema also have a higher risk of skin and other infections. And the frequent intense itching of eczema and its effect on the skin's appearance may contribute to a greater risk of mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression Silverberg said. Controlling flare-ups of eczema symptoms may help reduce the risk of problems such as sleep disturbance but heart disease and other conditions may develop due to eczema's long-term effects on the body Silverberg said. That's why it's important for treatment to not only improve symptoms in the short-term but also to manage eczema for the long-term he said.|

Climbing from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 the increases were particularly severe in low- and middle-income countries such as China and India the researchers noted. Global diabetes rates rose from just over 4 percent to 9 percent among men and from 5 percent to almost 8 percent among women the findings showed. The price tag for treating and managing the disease and its complications now totals $825 billion a year the report found. "Diabetes has become a defining issue for global public health. An aging population and rising levels of obesity mean that the number of people with diabetes has increased dramatically" said senior study author Majid Ezzati a professor at Imperial College London. The statistics were not divided between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. But 85 percent to 95 percent of adult diabetes cases are type 2. So the significant increase is likely due to a rise in type 2 diabetes which is often linked to obesity according to the study authors. The report is published in the April 6 issue of The Lancet. "Obesity is the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and our attempts to control rising rates of obesity have so far not proved successful" Ezzati said in a journal news release. "Identifying people who are at high risk of diabetes should be a particular priority since the onset can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle changes diet or medication" Ezzati added. Compared to Western Europe diabetes rates rose much more sharply in low- and middle-income countries such as China Egypt India Indonesia Mexico and Pakistan. No country had a major drop in diabetes rates the study authors said. In the United States just over 8 percent of men and more than 6 percent of women had diabetes in 2014. That translated to rankings of 114th for men and 146th for women in the world according to the report.|

There were 19659 hepatitis C-related deaths in 2014 according to preliminary data from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those tragically high numbers aren't necessary one CDC expert said. "Why are so many Americans dying of this preventable curable disease? Once hepatitis C testing and treatment are as routine as they are for high cholesterol and colon cancer we will see people living the long healthy lives they deserve" said Dr. Jonathan Mermin said in an agency news release. He directs the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD and TB Prevention. If not diagnosed and treated people with hepatitis C are at increased risk for liver cancer and other life-threatening diseases. They may also unknowingly infect others. The new CDC study found that the number of hepatitis C-related deaths in 2013 exceeded the combined number of deaths from 60 other infectious diseases including HIV and tuberculosis. The numbers might even be higher the agency said. That's because the new statistics are based on data from death certificates which often underreport hepatitis C. Most cases of hepatitis C are among baby boomers -- those born between 1945 and 1965. According to the CDC many were infected during medical procedures such as injections and blood transfusions when these procedures were not as safe as they are now. Many hepatitis C-infected "boomers" may even have lived with the disease for many years without knowing it the CDC said. The preliminary data also suggests a new wave of hepatitis C infections among injection drug users. These "acute" cases of hepatitis C infection more than doubled since 2010 increasing to 2194 reported cases in 2014 the CDC found. The new cases were mainly among young whites with a history of injection drug use who are living in rural and suburban areas of the Midwest and Eastern United States.|

Twenty-eight of the sunscreens did not deliver the promised SPF level says Trisha Calvo CR's deputy editor of health and food. And two products claiming an SPF of 50 actually weighed in with an SPF of 8 according to test results. This year's report includes ratings of lotions sprays sticks and facial sunscreens and reviews both adult and children's formulas. It also includes commonly asked questions about sunscreens such as what SPF (sun protection factor) and ''broad spectrum'' are. It will be published in the July issue of Consumer Reports magazine. Seventeen sunscreens earned a spot on the organization’s “recommended” list. "I think there are a lot of really good sunscreens on the market" Calvo says. The testing uses volunteers who soak in water after the sunscreens are applied and then have their skin exposed to UV light. The Personal Care Products Council a group that includes sunscreen makers questioned the process and say that their products meet FDA requirements and their own testing. Two products earned a perfect score: La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Melt-in Sunscreen Milk lotion with an SPF of 60 is priced at $7.20 an ounce. And Trader Joe's Spray with an SPF of 50-plus costs $6 for 6 ounces. The other 15 making the recommended list are:|

Zika is the first mosquito-borne illness known to cause birth defects U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden has reported. While the virus typically prompts either mild or no symptoms in nearly all adults it can inflict terrible brain-related birth defects if a pregnant woman becomes infected. Brazil has been the epicenter of the Zika outbreak with nearly 5000 confirmed or suspected cases of microcephaly which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brains. The virus is expected to become active in at least some portions of the continental United States this spring and summer especially Gulf Coast states as it passes from person to person via mosquito bites federal health officials say. Health experts are hopeful that Zika will not spread as widely in the United States as it has in Central and South America. The main reasons: people aren't as exposed to mosquitoes in the United States and much of the nation's climate isn't as tropical as Latin America's. "The fact that we have more access to screens and air conditioning by itself is probably very highly protective" Dr. John Hellerstedt commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services said during a recent Zika seminar. To limit any potential spread of Zika health officials on the federal state and local level are deploying a three-pronged strategy: improving mosquito control; expanding their ability to test for Zika; and urging the public to protect themselves against mosquitoes. However officials acknowledge it won't be possible to test every woman who's pregnant or might become pregnant to see if she has been infected with the virus. That's why self-protection and mosquito control are critical components of the Zika strategy officials say. Each state has a good idea which of its regions is more likely to have the Aedes aegypti mosquito the main carrier of Zika said Dr. Frank Welch. He is medical director of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals' Center for Community Preparedness.|

Social isolation raised that risk by about 30 percent exerting the same level of influence on heart health as risk factors such as anxiety and job stress the British review found. "Addressing loneliness and social isolation could have an important role in the prevention of two of the leading causes of ill health and mortality worldwide" said lead researcher Nicole Valtorta a research fellow in the department of health sciences at the University of York. "We take risk factors like obesity and physical inactivity for granted whereas we do not yet with social isolation and loneliness" she said. "The data from our study support us taking it seriously." But this analysis could not prove that loneliness and social isolation caused heart problems or strokes only that an association existed she added. "However if we put the study findings into context what we found is comparable in size to the effect of other psychosocial risk factors such as anxiety and job strain. Efforts to prevent heart disease and stroke could benefit from taking social isolation and loneliness into account" Valtorta said. The report was published online April 19 in the journal Heart. For the study Valtorta and her colleagues analyzed data from 23 previously published studies that in total included over 180000 adults more than 4600 of whom had heart attacks angina or died and more than 3000 who had suffered strokes. The pooled data showed that loneliness and social isolation were associated with a 29 percent increased risk of heart attack or angina attack and a 32 percent increased risk of stroke. Loneliness has been linked in past research to a weakened immune system high blood pressure and premature death the researchers explained. These findings suggest that loneliness and social isolation need to be taken seriously across the spectrum of medicine from medical education to guidelines and health care said Julianne Holt-Lunstad.

For information about infections in babies and young children see the topic Urinary Tract Infections in Children. Your urinary tract  is the system that makes urine and carries it out of your body. It includes your bladder and kidneys and the tubes that connect them. When germs get into this system they can cause an infection. Most urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bladder infections. A bladder infection usually is not serious if it is treated right away. If you do not take care of a bladder infection it can spread to your kidneys. A kidney infection is serious and can cause permanent damage. Usually germs get into your system through your urethra the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the outside of your body. The germs that usually cause these infections live in your large intestine and are found in your stool. If these germs get inside your urethra they can travel up into your bladder and kidneys and cause an infection. Women tend to get more bladder infections than men. This is probably because women have shorter urethras so it is easier for the germs to move up to their bladders. Having sex can make it easier for germs to get into a woman's urethra. You may be more likely to get an infection if you have diabetes or you are pregnant. The chance that you will get a bladder infection is higher if you have any problem that blocks the flow of urine from your bladder. Examples include having kidney stones or an enlarged prostate gland. For reasons that are not well understood some women get bladder infections again and again. You may have an infection if you have any of these symptoms: Call your doctor right away if you think you have an infection and:|
Wed Sep 07 14:05:55 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/6UbxIHennr, | Congress Can't Agree on Additional Zika Funding|, |['zika' 'zika virus' 'zika infection' 'birth defects' 'microcephaly' 'funding' 'fighting zika' 'mosquitoes' 'Congress'] |, |WEDNESDAY Sept. 7 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Congress returned to work Tuesday from its seven-week summer break and failed to agree on additional funding to fight the Zika virus. Federal and state health officials say the funding is needed as the mosquito-borne virus that causes severe birth defects continues to make inroads into Florida. The Miami area now has 56 documented cases of locally transmitted Zika infection which causes the birth defect microcephaly that leads to babies born with abnormally small heads and brains. There have been no reported locally transmitted cases of microcephaly in the continental United States. But thousands of cases have been documented in Latin America and the Caribbean with Brazil the epicenter of the outbreak. Health officials say it's also becoming increasingly clear that the Zika virus can be transmitted through sexual activity.  President Barack Obama in February asked for $1.9 billion in emergency spending to fight Zika. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives offered $1.1 billion in June but it came with the provision that none of the money could be given to Planned Parenthood because of that group's endorsement of abortion. Democrats have rejected that provision saying many lower-income women rely on Planned Parenthood for their health-care needs particularly in Puerto Rico where Zika infections are becoming widespread. In a related matter the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday recommended that all travelers -- male and female with symptoms or no symptoms -- practice safe sex or abstinence for six months after returning from areas where Zika is spreading. The United Nations health agency reiterated that mosquito bites are still the primary means of infection with the virus. The virus has also been linked to neurological complications and Guillain-Barre syndrome which can cause temporary paralysis. WHO officials said Tuesday's announcement was prompted by new evidence showing that: The vast majority of people infected with Zika experience no symptoms or mild ones such as a fever and a rash. But because of the risk of microcephaly WHO says men and women returning from areas where Zika infections are ongoing are "advised to wait at least six months before trying to conceive to ensure that possible virus infection has cleared."|
Fri Oct 21 15:49:50 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/LlzDHdYOrl, | error|, |['back pain' 'fake pill' 'placebo' 'pain' 'back pain relief' 'easing back pain' 'treating back pain'] |, |WEDNESDAY Oct. 19 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Even if they know the pills are fake chronic back pain sufferers may get relief from placebo drugs a new study indicates. Researchers found that patients who knowingly took a placebo pill while undergoing traditional treatment for lower back pain had less pain and disability than those who received traditional treatment alone. "These findings turn our understanding of the placebo effect on its head" said Ted Kaptchuk a joint senior author of the study and director of the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. "This new research demonstrates that the placebo effect is not necessarily elicited by patients' conscious expectation that they are getting an active medicine as long thought" Kaptchuk added in a hospital news release. "Taking a pill in the context of a patient-clinician relationship -- even if you know it's a placebo -- is a ritual that changes symptoms and probably activates regions of the brain that modulate symptoms." Kaptchuk's team gave 97 patients with chronic low back pain a 15-minute explanation of the placebo effect. Most were already taking medications for their pain including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS). None was taking strong prescription painkillers known as opioids. The patients were divided into two groups: those who only received traditional treatment and those who used traditional treatment along with a placebo pill. The dummy pills were provided in a bottle labeled "placebo pills" so it was clear they were a sham medication.  After three weeks the placebo group experienced a 30 percent reduction in their usual and maximum pain levels. The traditional treatment group reported a 9 percent drop in their usual amount of pain and a 16 percent reduction in their maximum pain the researchers said Pain-related disability was essentially unchanged among those who only received the traditional treatment while those who took the placebo pill experienced a 29 percent drop in disability.  "It's the benefit of being immersed in treatment: interacting with a physician or nurse taking pills all the rituals and symbols of our health care system" Kaptchuk said in the news release. "The body responds to that."|

After reviewing more than 250 studies that included a total of over 100000 participants researchers found that women's dissatisfaction with their thinness levels significantly declined between 1981 and 2012. "In the past few years we've seen more and more of the idea of body acceptance . . . and more media awareness [of this issue] growing from societal influences" said study author Bryan Karazsia. He's an associate professor of psychology at the College of Wooster in Ohio. Karazsia's analysis comes at a time when the U.S. National Institutes of Health says that about two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. But public relations and ad campaigns over the last decade -- such as the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty -- have attempted to promote body acceptance by showcasing models with wide variations in body types. Prior research in the 1990s had indicated that rising numbers of women were unhappy with their weight. Body dissatisfaction Karazsia noted can lead to greater risks of eating disorders or depression. The new meta-analysis examined changes in two aspects of body dissatisfaction over time including thinness and muscularity. Karazsia and his team compared participants' average scores over each study period using specialized measurements derived from self-reported surveys. Over the 31-year period that weight-related satisfaction was calculated women's dissatisfaction scores gradually declined while men's remained relatively constant. Meanwhile in a second analysis of another 81 studies relating to body image and musculature done with 23000 participants men reported more dissatisfaction with muscle size than women. But these levels remained consistent for both men and women over the 14-year study period. Karazsia said several possible factors could explain the new findings including "some evidence to believe that socio-cultural ideals are gradually shifting." "I do think the message is getting out there to be comfortable in your skin" he added. "It's OK to look a little different and embrace that. I think we're seeing more body diversity out there."|
Thu Jul 28 11:49:52 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/kFV1ZdfwSv, | Zika Now Tied to Miscarriage|, |['zika' 'zika virus' 'zika infection' 'pregnancy' 'miscarriage' 'pregnancy loss' 'fetus'] |, | HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY July 27 2016 (HealthDay News) --  Dutch researchers are reporting a case of miscarriage tied to maternal infection with the mosquito-borne Zika virus. The virus is best known for its links to a devastating fetal birth defect known as microcephaly where babies are born with smaller-than-expected heads and brains. But Zika's links to miscarriage haven't been clear. "Data linking Zika virus infection to fetal death have been reported in only a handful of cases" wrote a team led by Dr. Annemiek van der Eijk of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam the Netherlands. The researchers said a 31-year-old Dutch woman lost her baby at 11 weeks' gestation after contracting Zika on a trip to the South American country of Suriname.  Suriname borders Brazil which has been hit hard by thousands of cases of Zika-linked microcephaly. The report was published online July 27 in the New England Journal of Medicine.  In it the researchers described how the pregnant woman became ill with headache joint pain and rash the day after she returned to the Netherlands after more than three weeks in Suriname. She recovered after six days. But about two weeks after her symptoms first emerged doctors found no fetal heartbeat -- indicating a miscarriage -- when the woman went in for a routine ultrasound. She received a D&C (dilation and curettage) a week later. Traces of Zika virus were found in amniotic fluid placental tissue and in the mother's urine and blood van der Eijk's team noted.  The virus was also found in fetal stem cells suggesting that Zika "replicates in [these cells] involved in early stage embryo development" the researchers explained. The study can't prove that maternal Zika infection caused the miscarriage only that there was an association. However the Dutch team pointed out that traces of Zika virus in blood and fetal tissue were found for at least 21 days suggesting that the "window" for testing a pregnant woman for the virus may need to be expanded.  The current testing window set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is 14 days.|

But these "tough guys" tend to downplay their symptoms in front of male doctors because of a perceived need to keep up a strong front when interacting with men according to three recent studies. The results can be dangerous. "These studies highlight one theory about why masculinity is generally linked to poor health outcomes for men" said Mary Himmelstein. She is co-author of three recent studies on gender and medicine and a doctoral candidate in the department of psychology at Rutgers University in Piscataway N.J. "Men who really buy into this cultural script that they need to be tough and brave -- that if they don't act in a certain way they could lose their masculinity (or) 'man-card' (or) status -- are less likely to seek preventative care and delay care in the face of illness and injury" Himmelstein added. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention men born in 2009 will live five years less than women born the same year a spread not fully explained by physical differences the researchers noted. To see whether the male psyche drives some men to undermine their own health Himmelstein and co-author Diana Sanchez asked roughly 250 men to complete an online survey on gender perceptions and doctor preferences. The answers revealed that those with more masculine leanings were more likely to choose a male doctor. Another 250 men -- all undergraduate students -- participated in a staged medical exam conducted by male and female pre-med and nursing students. The upshot: The more macho the patients the less honest they were with their male caregiver. Those two trials were reported recently in the journal Preventive Medicine. A prior study conducted by Himmelstein and Sanchez -- published in the Journal of Health Psychology -- involved gender-role interviews with nearly 500 males and females. It found that guys with traditional masculine ideals were less likely to seek health care more likely to downplay symptoms and had worse overall health compared with women and less masculine men.|

At the same time studies show that those involved fathers have important effects on kids' health and well-being.         "From everyone's standpoint the more we can do to encourage fathers' involvement the better" said Dr. Michael Yogman a co-author of the report.         "It's beneficial for kids. Fathers aren't just 'redundant' doing the same things as mothers do" added Yogman who chairs the academy's committee on psychosocial aspects of child and family health.         Studies have found that older kids with involved fathers tend to have fewer depression symptoms and behavioral problems and lower rates of teen pregnancy.         When it comes to young children fathers can have effects on language development and mental health according to the academy. Research has shown that dads are more likely to use new words when they talk to their babies and preschoolers for example.         And fathers' typical ways of playing are different too Yogman said.         "It's a stereotype but it's true that fathers do more of the rough-and-tumble style of play" Yogman said. "They often encourage their children to explore and take risks while mothers offer stability and safety. There's room for both."         Research suggests that preschoolers tend to have fewer mental health symptoms -- like anxiety or aggression -- when their fathers are regularly involved in playtime the academy says.         None of that is to suggest that children of single moms do not fare well Yogman stressed. And he said the new report defines "father" in a broad sense -- not only the biological father who lives with a child.         It includes fathers who don't live with their children grandfathers and any male figure who's invested in a child's well-being.         The report was published online June 13 in the journal Pediatrics.         The fact that dads matter is not new but the report pulls together the growing body of research on fathers' impact said Eric Lewandowski a psychologist at NYU Langone's Child Study Center in New York City.|

Now a new study suggests that this rapid fetal growth happens early in pregnancy. British researchers found that babies born to mothers who were obese or had pregnancy-related diabetes were often already overly large by the sixth month of pregnancy. The researchers said the findings could have practical implications: Right now pregnant women are routinely screened for diabetes but often not until the sixth month (24 weeks). This study raises the question of whether that's too late said senior researcher Dr. Gordon Smith of the University of Cambridge. "Our study shows that the babies of obese women were more likely to be excessively large around the abdomen even as early as 20 weeks [into pregnancy]" Smith said. Women who were diagnosed with pregnancy-related diabetes showed a similar pattern -- though their babies' rapid growth became apparent a bit later at the 28th week of pregnancy he said. In the United States the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women be screened for pregnancy-related diabetes after the 24th week of pregnancy. But the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) does advise earlier screening for women at increased risk of pregnancy-related diabetes -- including those who are obese said Dr. Raul Artal. He is professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine in St. Louis. If a woman screens negative the test should be repeated between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy he added. Regardless having an excessively large baby is risky for a number of reasons Artal explained. For one it can complicate childbirth and necessitate a cesarean-section delivery. Big babies are also at risk of dangerous blood sugar lows and breathing difficulties after delivery said Artal. Some studies have also linked high birth weight to longer-term problems: Big babies may be at higher risk of obesity and diabetes later on according to Smith's team.|

In an online search researchers found at least 570 clinics offering unapproved stem cell "therapies." They tend to be concentrated in a handful of states -- including Arizona California Colorado Florida New York and Texas -- but are scattered across many other states too. Most often the clinics market stem cell procedures for orthopedic conditions such as arthritis and injured ligaments and tendons. This does have science behind it but is still experimental medical experts said. In other cases with little or no supporting evidence clinics hawked stem cell "facelifts" and therapies for serious conditions such as chronic lung disease Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. If these pricey stem cell treatments are unproven and unapproved by federal regulators how can these clinics exist? "I ask myself that question all the time" said Leigh Turner a bioethicist who worked on the study. Turner an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics said attention used to focus on "stem cell tourism" -- where people travel to countries such as China India and Mexico to get unproven treatments. "I think there's a misperception that everything here [in the U.S.] is regulated" Turner said. "But these clinics are operating here and on a relatively large scale." Stem cells are primitive cells with the potential to mature into various types of body tissue. Medical researchers have been studying the possibility of using stem cells to repair damaged tissue in a range of chronic ills -- with limited success so far. But the general public has heard about the "promise" of stem cells for years and it can be easy to be taken in by clinics' marketing tactics Turner said. Websites can for instance link to published medical studies that make their therapies seem legitimate Turner said. "These businesses can be quite savvy" he said. "I think it's asking too much to just tell consumers to be wary. We need to be asking why should these clinics be allowed to do this?"|

But can the ingredients often promoted as “natural” alternatives trigger abnormal breast growth in boys and girls? A few small studies suggest that frequently using lotions shampoos styling gels and even a certain cologne containing lavender and tea tree oils may cause breast growth in boys also known as gynecomastia along with breast growth in girls as young as 4 or 5. Other studies have not reached the same conclusions and the cases appear to be rare. In addition scientific research into most natural products is scant. The FDA doesn’t oversee essential oils unless they are intended for use in a drug making it challenging to know how safe and effective these products are. We asked a few experts to shed light on the research. Lavender and tea tree oils are among the most commonly used essential oils used. Although research is inconclusive lavender is often used for aromatherapy and calming lotions while tea tree oil is promoted for acne nail fungus and other skin conditions. In 2007 pediatrician Clifford Bloch MD noticed that three of his patients boys ages 4 7 and 10 had abnormal breast growth. After talking with their parents he learned that one had been exposed to a lavender-based “healing” balm another to a hair styling gel and shampoo with lavender and tea tree oil and another to a shampoo and skin lotion with lavender. Bloch ran tests looking for internal and external sources of the hormone estrogen that could potentially cause this to happen in the boys. He finally arrived at the cosmetic products the boys were using. Lavender and tea tree oil have phytoestrogens substances that mimic the hormone estrogen. Soy is a source of phytoestrogens too. Bloch’s findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine led to a 2007 National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) study that found both oils can act like estrogen. The study prompted the National Institutes of Health to issue an alert about lavender and tea tree oils potentially acting as endocrine disruptors -- something that interferes with the endocrine system -- in boys who regularly used products containing them.|

Faster aging of blood vessel cells exposed to the antacid Nexium (esomeprazole) might potentially hinder the tasks these cells perform to prevent heart attack and stroke the new study suggests. These lab results could explain why other studies have shown increased risk of heart disease in people who use proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) -- the class of heartburn medication that includes Nexium said study senior author Dr. John Cooke. "Our finding that the lining of blood vessels is impaired by proton pump inhibitors is a unifying mechanism for the reports that PPI users are at increased risk for heart attack stroke and renal failure" said Cooke chair of cardiovascular sciences at the Houston Methodist Research Institute. AstraZeneca the maker of Nexium responded with a statement noting that the study was conducted in a laboratory setting "not in humans within a controlled clinical trial. Therefore conclusions around cause and effect cannot be made. "Patient safety is an important priority for AstraZeneca and we believe all of our PPI medicines are generally safe and effective when used in accordance with the label" the drug maker said. However many people aren't using PPIs in accordance with FDA guidelines which in Nexium's case would limit them to a four-week course of treatment three times a year Cooke said. "They are being used ubiquitously for long periods of time. They aren't being used as originally approved" Cooke said. Dr. P.K. Shah director of the Oppenheimer Atherosclerosis Research Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles said these study results provide a reasonable explanation for how PPIs might affect the heart health of long-term users. "We have clinical data that raises a suspicion that they might be bad if used long-term and we have now experimental data that suggests a potential mechanism" Shah said. "But we still have unanswered questions."|

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which foods containing gluten trigger the immune system to attack and damage the small intestine according to the Celiac Disease Foundation. Gluten is a protein found naturally in grains like wheat barley and rye. People with celiac disease have no choice but to avoid gluten in their diet. If they don't their small intestine is damaged every time they eat something with gluten. Gluten-free diets also appear to have become a trendy way to address any sort of gastrointestinal problem said lead author Dr. Hyun-seok Kim an internal medicine resident at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark N.J. "People may have a gluten sensitivity or non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms and simply assume that a gluten-free diet will help their symptoms" Kim said. The number of Americans following a gluten-free diet tripled between 2009 and 2014 but diagnoses of celiac disease remained stable during that same period the researchers found. It's possible that decreased gluten consumption could be contributing to the plateau in celiac disease the study authors said. For their study Kim and his colleagues reviewed data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys a regular survey of American health and diet conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The team identified more than 22000 survey participants -- aged 6 and older -- who had blood tests for celiac disease. The survey volunteers were asked whether they had been diagnosed with celiac disease or were following a gluten-free diet. "The therapy for celiac disease is being on a gluten-free diet" Kim said. Based on their analysis the researchers estimated there are around 1.76 million people with celiac disease in the United States. About 2.7 million more people adhere to a gluten-free diet even though they don't have celiac disease the findings showed.|

"These results provide further evidence on the benefits of physical activity particularly in societies where increasing numbers of people have to sit for long hours for work or commuting" said lead researcher Ulf Ekelund. He is a professor in physical activity and health at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo Norway. "Unfortunately only 25 percent of our sample exercised an hour a day or more" he said. The study also found that watching TV for three hours or more a day was linked with an increased risk of early death regardless of physical activity -- except among those who were the most physically active. However even among those who exercised the most the risk of premature death was significantly increased if they watched five hours of TV a day or more the researchers added. It's not TV per se that is associated with an increased risk of dying early; rather TV is a marker for sitting and not being active Ekelund said. In their review of 16 previously published studies that included more than one million people the researchers divided the participants into four groups: those who got about 5 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a day; 25 to 35 minutes a day; 50 to 65 minutes day; and 60 to 75 minutes a day.  The increased risk of early death ranged from 12 percent to 59 percent depending on how much exercise the participants got the findings showed. "Indeed those belonging to the most active group and who are active about 60 to 75 minutes per day seem to have no increased risk of mortality even if they sit for more than eight hours a day" Ekelund said. "Sit less move more and the more you move the better" he suggested.|

Women's internal or circadian body clocks run at a faster pace than men's according to the research. It's as if women operate in a different "internal time zone" said study lead author Dr. Diane Boivin professor of psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal. "They go to bed at a later biological time because their clock is shifted earlier eastward" Boivin said. Boivin also directs the Centre for Study and Treatment of Circadian Rhythms at Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Montreal a McGill affiliate. The way women sleep throughout the 24-hour circadian day also outpaces men the study showed. Boivin said these two findings explain why women's sleep-wake cycle runs about two hours ahead of men. Women are more likely than men to report insomnia at least a few days a week and experience daytime sleepiness according to the National Sleep Foundation a U.S.-based nonprofit organization. What makes this new study unique is that the researchers controlled for women's menstrual cycle phases and hormonal contraceptive use. Reported sleep differences occurred regardless of hormonal changes which can affect sleep the study authors said. "Even though the study is small it definitely adds knowledge to our scientific literature on sex differences in sleep in context of circadian rhythm" said Monica Mallampalli vice president of scientific affairs at the Society for Women's Health Research in Washington D.C. Jennifer Martin associate professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles suggested: "Perhaps women are predisposed to having insomnia based on their circadian phase." "In the face of similar stressors women are more likely than men to experience poor sleep as a result" Martin said. The study was reported Sept. 12 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It involved 15 men and 11 women about 25 years old on average.  Over a 36-hour period participants were isolated in a windowless room where researchers controlled their exposure to light and monitored changes in core body temperature melatonin levels sleep and alertness.|

The agency said these side effects are concerning enough that doctors should not prescribe these drugs to people with sinusitis bronchitis or uncomplicated urinary tract infections when they have other treatment options. Cipro is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in this class of antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones. Some of the reported side effects include pain in the tendons joints or muscles a "pins-and-needles" sensation confusion and hallucinations. Anyone who experiences these symptoms while taking these drugs should contact their doctor immediately the agency advised in a statement on its website. The FDA had issued two previous warnings about some of the side effects associated with these drugs in 2008 and 2013 but this is the first time the agency is recommending that doctors not prescribe them for certain patients.|

But the commonly prescribed anti-seizure drug valproate was linked with lower IQs in children especially when taken at higher doses researchers say. "The treatment of epilepsy in women who are considering a pregnancy or are pregnant involves optimizing the health of the mother as well as keeping the risk to the fetus as low as possible" said lead researcher Rebecca Bromley a research fellow at the Institute for Human Development at the University of Manchester. In the study children exposed to levetiracetam (Keppra) or topiramate (Topamax) in the womb did not differ from children not exposed to these drugs. And they had better outcomes than the children exposed to valproate (Depakote) in terms of their IQ thinking and language skills Bromley said. "These data can be used by doctors and women to help them make their decisions about which medication is best for them" she added. For the study Bromley and her colleagues used the U.K. Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register to identify 171 women with epilepsy who had a child between 5 and 9 years old. During their pregnancy 42 of the women took levetiracetam 27 took topiramate and 47 took valproate the researchers said. Bromley's team compared the women with epilepsy with 55 women who did not take epilepsy drugs during pregnancy. The children had their IQ measured and took tests on verbal and nonverbal comprehension and how fast they could process visual information. The researchers found that children of women who took levetiracetam or topiramate did not have lower IQs or other thinking-skill problems compared with kids of mothers who did not take these drugs no matter what dose of these drugs were taken. Children whose mothers took valproate however had the lowest IQs of the study Bromley said. These kids scored on average 11 points lower on the IQ test.  Among children whose mothers took valproate 19 percent had IQs lower than the average score of 100 compared with 6 percent among kids whose mothers did not take any epilepsy drugs during pregnancy the researchers found.|

"Modern homes are filled with noisy distractions such as TV radio and people talking that could affect how children learn words at early ages" said study leader Brianna McMillan. "Our study suggests that adults should be aware of the amount of background speech in the environment when they're interacting with young children" said McMillan a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  Researchers from the university assessed the ability of 106 children aged 22 to 30 months to learn new words. They found they were more successful when their surroundings were quiet than when there was background noise. But providing the children with additional language cues helped them overcome the detrimental effects of a noisy environment according to the study. The findings appear July 21 in the journal Child Development. "Learning words is an important skill that provides a foundation for children's ability to achieve academically" McMillan said in a journal news release. Because of urban settings and crowding homes in lower-income areas tend to have higher-than-normal noise levels according to background notes with the study. "Hearing new words in fluent speech without a lot of background noise before trying to learn what objects the new words corresponded to may help very young children master new vocabulary" said study co-author Jenny Saffran a professor of psychology.  "But when the environment is noisy drawing young children's attention to the sounds of the new word may help them compensate" she added.|

A group of either healthy weight or mildly overweight people who followed a calorie-restricted diet for two years lost nearly 17 pounds on average and enjoyed significant quality-of-life improvement said lead author Corby Martin. He is director for behavioral sciences and epidemiology with the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge La. "Even among people who are relatively healthy you see these positive biological and physiological changes occurring with calorie restriction" Martin said. Participants felt better and lost weight even though they fell short by half of their original calorie-cutting goal Martin noted. Researchers had asked study participants to restrict their calorie intake by 25 percent but over two years they only achieved an average 12 percent calorie reduction. "A 25 percent reduction in caloric intake for most people is going to be very challenging" said Dr. Scott Kahan director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness in Washington D.C. "Despite only achieving 12 percent you still see the really big benefits of that degree of caloric decrease and we have lots of data from other studies showing even smaller changes lead to very impressive outcomes." Until now studies have shown that cutting calories can make a big difference in the health and well-being of obese people but it's been an open question whether dieting would help or harm people at or near a healthy weight Martin said. For their clinical trial Martin and his colleagues recruited 220 people with a body mass index (BMI) between 22 and 28. Average age was nearly 38 and 70 percent were women. Healthy weight runs from 18.5 to 24.9 BMI while overweight runs from 25 to 29.9 BMI according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher. Almost two-thirds of the participants were asked to restrict their daily calories by 25 percent for two years while the other third could eat whatever they wanted.|

Symptoms include ulcers or sores inside or around the mouth and a rash or blisters on the hands feet legs or buttocks. And while it's not pleasant it also isn't serious. Anyone can get the disease but children under age 10 are most likely to catch it. You can take steps to ease the symptoms while it runs its course though. The viruses that usually cause hand-foot-and-mouth are named coxsackievirus a16 and enterovirus 71. In fact you might hear your child’s doctor refer to it as the coxsackie virus. Your child can catch hand-foot-and-mouth through contact with someone who has it or from something that's been in contact with the virus like a toy tabletop or doorknob. It tends to spread easily in the summer and fall. Early symptoms may include fever and a sore throat. Painful blisters similar to cold sores can show up on the inside of your child's mouth or on his tongue. He might get a rash on the palms of his hands or the soles of his feet a day or two after the first symptoms appear. This rash may turn into blisters. Flat spots or sores may pop up on the knees elbows or buttocks. He could have all of these symptoms or only one or two. Mouth sores can make it hurt to swallow so be sure your child gets enough water and calories. Your doctor will ask about your child’s symptoms and look at any sores or rashes. This is usually enough to decide if it’s hand-foot-and-mouth disease with no extra tests. But he might take a throat swab or a stool or blood sample to be sure.|

The study which followed patients at five fertility clinics in California found that more than half of women and one-third of men had clinical-level depression symptoms at some point. Even more -- 76 percent of women and 61 percent of men -- had symptoms of clinical anxiety. Yet only about one-quarter of all patients said their fertility center had given them any information on mental health resources. "It was very surprising to find that" said lead researcher Lauri Pasch an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco. Many studies have found that infertility patients often feel distressed. And Pasch said professional groups have underscored the need for patients' emotional health to be addressed. "It seems like we're doing a terrible job of it" Pasch said. In the United States about one in eight couples has trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy according to Resolve: The National Infertility Association. There are various treatment options for infertility -- from drugs that stimulate ovulation to in vitro fertilization. But it often takes more than one treatment cycle and if patients are emotionally distressed they may give up when they still have a shot at success Pasch said. That's one reason why clinics should pay attention to patients' mental health she said. Dr. Brooke Hodes-Wertz of the NYU Langone Fertility Center in New York City agreed that it's no secret that many infertility patients are emotionally distressed. And it's routine for patients to be asked about any history of depression or anxiety before they start treatment said Hodes-Wertz who was not involved in the study. But what happens after that she said varies from one fertility center to another. Based on the current findings "there's clearly room for improvement" Hodes-Wertz said. The study included 352 women and 274 men seen at one of five San Francisco-area fertility clinics. The participants were interviewed before starting treatment and again four 10 and 18 months later.|

The sugar industry paid Harvard University nutrition scientists to build a case against saturated fat and cholesterol as primary causes of heart disease while downplaying the negative health effects of sugary foods and beverages according to researchers at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Those Harvard scientists received the equivalent of $50000 in today's dollars the investigators said. As a result consumers may have been misled for decades into thinking only saturated fat harmed the heart and not sweets the researchers said. During that time obesity and associated ills like diabetes reached alarming levels in the United States. "There are all kinds of ways that you can subtly manipulate the outcome of a study which industry is very well practiced at" said the study's senior author Stanton Glantz a professor of medicine at UCSF. "As the saying goes he who pays the piper calls the tune" Glantz said in a university news release.  The Sugar Association said it still supports industry-funded research but admitted it should have been more open about past its involvement. For its report the UCSF team searched public archives for internal corporate documents from the sugar industry.  According to their analysis the sugar industry was aware by the 1950s that if people cut fat out of their diets their sugar intake would jump by about 30 percent. Around this time studies began to warn of a link between sugar and risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol and triglycerides the researchers said. As media attention on the health risks associated with sugar increased a trade group for the sugar industry -- the Sugar Research Foundation -- commissioned a research review by Harvard scientists. (The trade group today is called the Sugar Association.) The association report appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967.  "The literature review helped shape not only public opinion on what causes heart problems but also the scientific community's view of how to evaluate dietary risk factors for heart disease" said Dr. Cristin Kearns lead author of the new study. It was Kearns who unearthed the industry documents.|

However the researchers did find that women who took the drugs had a slightly higher risk of less serious heart problems such as an abnormal heart beat or swelling and irritation of the membrane surrounding the heart. "Our study is a comprehensive assessment of the impact aromatase inhibitors have on cardiovascular risk and provides reassurance that the hormone therapy to reduce breast cancer recurrence does not increase risk of the most fatal cardiovascular events" said study author Reina Haque. She is a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente's Southern California Department of Research and Evaluation. "A particular strength of our study is that we accounted for women's other potential cardiovascular risk factors as well as medication used to treat high blood pressure and high cholesterol" Haque added in a Kaiser news release. The study was published April 21 in the journal JAMA Oncology.  Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in older breast cancer survivors the study authors said. Previous research has linked tamoxifen another commonly prescribed hormone-altering drug with a serious risk of stroke they added. The new study included more than 13000 postmenopausal women. The women were diagnosed with either progesterone or estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. That means the growth of the breast cancer is fueled by one of those hormones. The cancers were diagnosed between 1991 and 2010. The women's health was followed through 2011. As part of their breast cancer treatment plan some postmenopausal women take only aromatase inhibitors. In other cases women may take tamoxifen for one to five years and then begin using aromatase inhibitors the researchers explained. In this study more than 28 percent of the women took aromatase inhibitors. Almost 32 percent took tamoxifen. About 20 percent took both drugs. Just over 19 percent didn't take either drug the researchers said. The study found that women who took aromatase inhibitors didn't have a higher risk for heart attacks and stroke than those who took tamoxifen did. But women who took only aromatase inhibitors or used them after tamoxifen treatment had up to a 29 percent higher risk of less serious heart problems than those who took only tamoxifen the research revealed.|
Mon Apr 11 18:20:44 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/xOnhQvqdBG, | error|, |['hormone therapy' 'prostate cancer' 'depression'] |, |MONDAY April 11 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Older men who receive testosterone-suppressing therapy for prostate cancer may be at increased risk of developing depression a new large study suggests. The findings are based on over 78000 U.S. men treated for earlier-stage prostate cancer. Researchers found that among those given hormone-suppressing therapy 7 percent developed clinical depression in the next few years. That compared with 5 percent of men who did not have the treatment. The findings do not prove that hormone therapy is to blame. But they do offer "pretty strong evidence" that might be the case said senior researcher Dr. Paul Nguyen. He is director of prostate brachytherapy at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Nguyen said his team accounted for some other factors that could affect depression risk -- including the severity of a man's cancer his age and education. And there was still a connection between hormone therapy and depression. Plus Nguyen said the longer the men were on hormone therapy the higher the risk of depression. Of men who were treated for six months or less 6 percent developed depression within three years of their cancer diagnosis. That rose to 8 percent among men who were on hormone therapy for at least a year the investigators found. Dr. Mayer Fishman is a medical oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Miami who has studied the side effects of hormone therapy for prostate cancer. He and his colleagues have found a similar link between the therapy and depression symptoms. "What I like about this study is that it's large and it puts a number on the risk" said Fishman who was not involved in the research. So while it tells men and their doctors that hormone therapy may contribute to depression Fishman said "it also puts the risk in context." Why would hormone therapy raise a man's likelihood of depression? Nguyen pointed to a few possible reasons. "It could be a direct effect of reduced testosterone levels on mood" he said. "But there could also be indirect effects."|

Babies 6 months and younger whose mothers had a flu vaccine during pregnancy were 70 percent less likely to have lab-confirmed flu than babies born to mothers who didn't have the immunization while pregnant. In addition the babies born to mothers immunized during pregnancy had an 80 percent reduction in flu-related hospitalizations the study found. "Children younger than 6 months are too young to be vaccinated" said the study's lead author Dr. Julie Shakib.  "The best way to protect infants younger than 6 months is to make sure everyone around them is vaccinated. Immunizing pregnant women provides immunity to the baby through the placenta. Immunizing others who live with or care for the baby prevents them from getting the flu and passing it to the baby" said Shakib assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Utah School of Medicine. The study authors called the need to get more pregnant women immunized "a public health priority."  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all pregnant women receive the flu vaccine to protect both the mother and the baby. Pregnancy causes changes that make women more susceptible to the flu and its complications the CDC says. And babies can't receive a flu vaccine of their own until they're at least 6 months old according to the CDC. The flu vaccine isn't recommended for infants under 6 months of age because their immune systems can't yet respond to the vaccine in a way that would allow them to develop enough protective antibodies Dr. Tina Tan said. She's a professor of pediatrics at Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago and was not involved with the study. For the study the researchers reviewed more than 245000 health records of pregnant women and more than 249000 infant records. Information was available for nine flu seasons from December 2005 through March 2014. Only about 10 percent of these women reported being vaccinated while pregnant the study revealed.|

The analysis of hundreds of clinical trials found no evidence that any one diabetes drug or drug combination beats out the others. Researchers said the results bolster current recommendations to first try an older cheaper drug -- metformin (Glumetza Glucophage) -- for most patients with type 2 diabetes. "There are very few things experts agree on but this is one of them" said Dr. Kevin Pantalone a diabetes specialist at the Cleveland Clinic and a member of the Endocrine Society. "Metformin in the absence of contraindications or intolerability should be the first-line agent to treat patients with type 2 diabetes" he said. Metformin can cause upset stomach and diarrhea so some patients are unable to stick with it day to day explained Pantalone who wasn't involved in the study. And people with kidney disease generally shouldn't take it he said. More than 29 million Americans have diabetes -- mostly type 2 according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease which is often linked to obesity causes blood sugar levels to be chronically high. Over time that can lead to complications such as heart disease stroke kidney failure and nerve damage the CDC says. There are numerous classes of medications that lower blood sugar levels. What's been unclear is whether any of those drugs work better than others in warding off diabetes complications and extending people's lives. The new analysis found no obvious winners. But the researchers also cautioned against drawing conclusions: The trials in the review were not specifically designed to see whether any of the medications prolong people's lives. Mainly they looked at "biochemical" effects -- like whether the drugs lower blood sugar explained Suetonia Palmer the lead researcher on the work. "So what we know is that currently there is no good evidence that one drug can improve life expectancy better than another -- either when they are used as the only drug for treatment or when added to metformin" said Palmer. She's an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Otago in New Zealand.|
Tue Jul 19 11:58:07 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/G07Moe8MMZ, | error|, |['prostate cancer' 'prostate' 'prostate cancer screening' 'advanced prostate cancer' 'aggressive prostate cancer' 'men' 'advanced prostate cancer rate'] |, |TUESDAY July 19 2016 (HealthDay News) -- New cases of advanced prostate cancer in the United States have skyrocketed 72 percent in the past decade a troubling new study shows. The biggest increase was among men aged 55 to 69 with a 92 percent jump seen over 10 years. This rise is worrisome because these men are the ones who may benefit most from screening and early treatment the researchers said. "The increase could be because the disease is becoming more aggressive or it could be because there is less screening being done but we don't know why" said lead researcher Dr. Edward Schaeffer. He is chair of urology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. It's possible that prostate cancer may be getting more aggressive Schaeffer said but statistics also show that fewer men are being screened. That's the probable consequence of a 2012 recommendation by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that said men should not be screened for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). PSA a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland is often elevated in men with prostate cancer. "My major issue with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation was it completely excluded the patient from the decision-making process" Schaeffer said. "PSA screening saves lives period." The men in the study who were diagnosed in 2013 versus 2004 had higher PSAs -- twice as high -- which implies that these men were not well screened Schaeffer said. However since advanced cancer cases began increasing before the change in the screening recommendation researchers can't definitively link the increase in cases to reduced screening alone Schaeffer said. And this study was not designed to prove that either factor caused an increase in advanced prostate cancer cases. Men should talk with their doctor about being screened for prostate cancer Schaeffer said. For men with an average risk screening should start at 50. For men at increased risk screening should start at 40. Screening can stop when a man has less than 10 years of life expectancy he said.|

In two small studies participants who burned the same number of calories through exercise as those who cut back on food intake ate almost one-third less at a buffet meal. Men and women also seemed to show similar hunger-hormone responses to exercise-induced calorie deficits. "Some researchers have claimed that women's appetites appetite hormones and food intake are more likely to increase after exercise than men's" said study author David Stensel a lecturer in exercise metabolism at Loughborough University in England. "Our new study shows that this is not the case -- at least over the course of a single day" he added. "We have seen this previously in men but were curious to see if women responded in the same way." The research was published in the March issue of the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. In one study Stensel and his team analyzed hormonal psychological and behavioral responses to calorie control through exercise and food restriction over nine hours in a group of 12 healthy women. Participants whose calorie deficit stemmed from restricting food intake exhibited increased levels of the "hunger hormone" ghrelin and lower levels of a hunger-suppressing hormone called peptide YY according to the study.  At a buffet meal these women also ate an average of 944 calories compared to 660 calories for participants whose calorie deficits were created by running on a treadmill the investigators found. In the other study 10 men and 10 women completed 60 minutes of running at the start of a seven-hour trial. Appetite perception appetite hormones and food intake after exercise did not appear to differ between the sexes. Stensel emphasized that the appetite-suppressing effects of exercise are strongest during vigorous workouts. "The take-home message is that exercise will not necessarily make you overeat or compensate by eating more food" he said. "There is a widespread perception that exercise will make you hungry and cause you to overeat. We have shown this is not necessarily the case at least in the short term."|

The study included 240 Crohn's disease patients in the United Kingdom who were followed for three years after bowel surgery. Crohn's disease occurs when the immune system attacks the lining of the gut and bowel and causes severe inflammation the study authors noted. This can result in diarrhea abdominal pain nausea and reduced appetite. Patients are usually initially treated with drugs to suppress their immune system. But the study authors said that more than half of Crohn's patients eventually have surgery to remove the affected section of their bowel. However surgery does not cure Crohn's and relapses are common. According to the researchers from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland smokers were much more likely than nonsmokers to relapse after surgery. The investigators also assessed whether a class of drugs called thiopurines (such as mercaptopurine brand names Purinethol and Purixan) do a good job preventing relapse after surgery. This type of drug which is often used to treat Crohn's did reduce the risk of relapse among smokers but not among nonsmokers the study found. The findings suggest that Crohn's patients who smoke should be offered thiopurines immediately after surgery but there is no evidence to support the use of these drugs in nonsmokers the researchers said. "Our study confirms that the most important thing somebody with Crohn's disease can do for their health is not to smoke" study author Jack Satsangi said in a university news release. He is head of the university's gastrointestinal unit at the Center of Genomic and Experimental Medicine. For nonsmokers having bowel surgery "close monitoring in the first year is the best course of action rather than immediate drug therapy" Satsangi added. The study was published Aug. 30 in The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology.|

And those kids who are exposed seem to suffer worse health effects than those exposed to traditional cigarettes the study authors added. The biggest threat with e-cigarettes appears to be the nicotine liquid inside the devices the researchers said. "If this were an infectious disease this would be headlines across the country" said Dr. Gary Smith director of Nationwide Children's Hospital's Center for Injury Research and Policy in Ohio. He noted that the number of e-cigarette exposures in kids jumped 1500 percent from 2012 to 2015.  "E-cigarettes and liquid nicotine can cause serious poisoning and even death among young children" he said. "Like other dangerous poisons they should be kept out of sight and reach of children preferably in a locked location." The research published online May 9 in the journal Pediatrics follows last week's ban by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors because of numerous health concerns in this vulnerable age group. "This final rule is a foundational step that enables the FDA to regulate products young people were using at alarming rates like e-cigarettes cigars and hookah tobacco which had gone largely unregulated" Mitch Zeller director of the FDA Center for Tobacco Products said during a May 9 media briefing announcing the ban. Smokers have flocked to e-cigs in recent years. The battery-powered devices heat up fluid until it becomes vapor which is then inhaled. The fluid includes nicotine and other ingredients such as flavors and chemicals. The new report suggests e-cigarettes particularly the liquid nicotine may pose the greatest harm to really young children. The researchers analyzed calls to the National Poison Data System about nicotine and tobacco products from January 2012 to April 2015. They focused on calls about kids under the age of 6. According to the study about 14 percent of calls were about exposure to e-cigarettes compared to 60 percent about exposure to traditional cigarettes. In about 92 percent of the e-cig cases the kids swallowed liquid nicotine.|

Married people seem to have a marked survival advantage the researchers found: Single men with cancer had a death rate 27 percent higher than it was for married male patients while the death rate for single female patients was 19 percent higher than their married counterparts. "The effects that we find were actually quite notable" said study author Scarlett Lin Gomez a research scientist with the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. "They are comparable to some of the more clinical factors we often see that are associated with cancer prognosis like stage of disease or certain types of treatment." What's more this advantage appears to rely solely on the emotional bonds of matrimony and not the financial advantages that marriage offers Gomez said. "These patterns were very minimally explained by the married patients having greater economic resources" Gomez said. "Specifically we looked at health insurance and we looked at living in a higher socioeconomic status neighborhood. Even though these played a small role they really didn't explain the greater survival among the married." It should be noted that the study only found an association between marital status and cancer prognosis; it did not prove a cause-and-effect link. Previous studies over the past 10 to 15 years have shown a similar marriage benefit for cancer patients Gomez said but the benefit has always been chalked up to the love and support a person receives from their spouse. But married people also tend to have greater combined incomes and better access to insurance Gomez said. She and her colleagues decided to see whether money played a role in the survival advantage of married couples. For the analysis the researchers examined health records of nearly 800000 adults in California who were diagnosed with invasive cancer between 2000 and 2009 and were followed through 2012. The study published April 11 in the journal Cancer revealed that financial resources did not have much impact on a person's chance of beating cancer Gomez said.|
Tue Nov 29 13:30:16 EST 2016,   https://t.co/RkNigpjdD4, | Fast-Food Calorie Labeling Not Working|, |['fast food' 'fast food calories' 'calorie labeling' 'healthier eating' 'obese' 'obesity'] |, |MONDAY Nov. 28 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Does it help to know that a double quarter-pounder with cheese delivers 740 calories? Probably not a new study suggests. Starting next May fast-food chains with more than 20 locations in the United States must display calorie counts on menus. But this study questions whether the well-intended regulations will actually steer customers to less-fattening foods. Research in Philadelphia where such rules already exist indicate as few as 8 percent of fast-food eaters make healthy choices based on menu calorie counts the study found.  "I believe menu labeling has been an important policy effort to combat a public health problem for which we have few solutions" said study author Andrew Breck. "The success of such a calorie-labeling campaign however requires that target consumers simultaneously see the calorie labels are motivated to eat healthfully and understand how many calories they should be eating" said Breck. He is a doctoral candidate at NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service in New York City. Simply presenting calorie information is not enough he and his colleagues stressed.  To be effective nutrition labeling must be clearer and larger. It must also reach regular fast-food eaters -- people who expressed more concern with cost and convenience than nutrition Breck and his colleagues found.  The trend toward nutrition labeling on fast-food menus began in response to the U.S. obesity epidemic. About 38 percent of adults and 17 percent of teenagers are obese according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity has been linked to a greater risk of high blood pressure stroke diabetes cancer and other health issues.  Philadelphia in 2010 required fast-food restaurants to post the caloric fat and sodium content of meals. New York City and Seattle already had similar rules.  But based on interviews with 1400 people in Philadelphia Breck's team concluded that significant labeling  improvements are needed for such laws to have an impact. The researchers analyzed responses from about 700 customers at 15 fast-food eateries in Philadelphia and another 700 people interviewed by phone.|
Thu Apr 14 18:44:16 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/5GiJrVs2Yq, | About Half of Women Benefit From Mammograms at 40?|, |['mammograms' 'breast cancer'] |, |THURSDAY April 14 2016 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that all women turning 40 should get a breast cancer risk assessment since half of them may have risks that are high enough to warrant annual mammograms right away. The finding is important because the latest guidelines on mammograms advise that most women can wait until the age of 45 or 50 to start having annual screenings. But the review of female patients between the ages of 40 and 44 found that 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer and therefore would be eligible to begin screening mammography at age 40 said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Plichta. She's a breast surgery fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. The study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods including breast MRI and genetic testing Plichta said. "We believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40 and those who would qualify for screening MRIs and genetic testing" Plichta said. Plichta was to present her team's findings Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting in Dallas. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons. The cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015 recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms. Previously the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40. The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation Plichta said. However she noted the ASBS added a few extra conditions:|

The findings could be important to both makers of e-cigarettes and regulators who want to reduce the health threat posed by the devices according to researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. "Advocates of e-cigarettes say emissions are much lower than from conventional cigarettes so you're better off using e-cigarettes" study corresponding author Hugo Destaillats said in a Berkeley news release. "I would say that may be true for certain users -- for example long-time smokers that cannot quit -- but the problem is it doesn't mean that they're healthy. Regular cigarettes are super unhealthy. E-cigarettes are just unhealthy" he explained. In laboratory tests scientists found that the heat-related breakdown of propylene glycol and glycerin -- two solvents found in most e-cigarette liquids -- causes emissions of toxic chemicals such as acrolein acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. All three are either respiratory irritants or carcinogens the investigators said. "Understanding how these compounds are formed is very important. One reason is for regulatory purposes and the second is if you want to manufacture a less harmful e-cigarette you have to understand what the main sources of these carcinogens are" Destaillats said. The researchers also found that levels of harmful chemicals in e-cigarette vapor increase between the first few puffs and later puffs as the device gets hotter and with each use of the device. Starting Aug. 8 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will begin regulating e-cigarettes as well as all cigars hookahs (waterpipes) tobacco pipe tobacco and nicotine gels among other products. The new study was published July 27 in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.|

About one in nine men will suffer a cardiac arrest before the age of 70 compared to about one in 30 women. At age 45 men have nearly an 11 percent lifetime risk of sudden cardiac death compared with a 3 percent risk among women of the same age researchers report. "Most of these deaths are occurring prematurely -- before age 70 -- which means that this is a very important and largely preventable cause of death that's really affecting families in a devastating way" said lead researcher Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones. He is chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. About 450000 Americans die from sudden cardiac death each year and most never have any symptoms of a heart problem he said. Men are especially at risk because heart disease tends to develop earlier in men than in women Lloyd-Jones explained. "We need to get more serious about screening men for risk factors for cardiac arrest" he said. The major risk factors include smoking high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes. "Know your numbers especially your blood pressure but also know your cholesterol or whether you have diabetes" he said. "At 50 men should also have a baseline electrocardiogram which might reveal heart problems." For the study Lloyd-Jones and his colleagues examined data on more than 5200 men and women aged 28 to 62 who took part in the long-running Framingham Heart Study which began in 1948. That study looked at four major risk factors for heart trouble -- blood pressure cholesterol smoking and diabetes. None of the participants had a heart problem at the start of the study. Because most of those in the study were white the findings cannot necessarily be applied to other groups the researchers cautioned. Over decades of follow-up 375 people died from a cardiac arrest. The risk for sudden cardiac death was even higher -- 12 percent -- among men who had two or more risk factors the researchers found.|

In those cases umbilical cord blood may work as well as current alternatives -- or even better in some cases a new study suggests. "Often cord-blood transplant is thought to be only as the last resource for patients without donors. But cord blood does not have to be considered only an alternative donor source" said study lead author Dr. Filippo Milano. "In centers with experience it can yield to great outcomes" said Milano an assistant member of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. At issue: How best to treat the blood cancer leukemia and a related condition called myelodysplastic syndrome? One approach replaces a patient's blood-producing bone marrow through a transplant. The "gold standard" is to find a relative who can donate bone marrow or stem cells preferably a "matched" sibling whose blood is compatible with the patient's Milano said. But for 70 percent of patients this ideal fit doesn't occur the study authors noted. Physicians then might recommend a transplant from a compatible donor unrelated to the patient or an unrelated donor who's mostly (but not entirely) compatible.  This new study considers another option: A donation of cord blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of newborn babies. Like bone marrow or stem cell transplants a cord-blood transplant can produce stem cells that create new blood. "However cord-blood donors and recipients don't need to be a perfect match" Milano said.  To compare the success of the different options researchers looked at 582 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. If a compatible bone marrow or stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor wasn't available the patients got either a cord-blood transplant or an incompatible bone marrow or stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor Milano said. "Our study showed that overall survival after cord-blood transplantation was comparable to the one observed after matched unrelated transplants" Milano said. And patients who got cord-blood transplants seemed to live longer than those who got non-matching bone marrow or stem cell transplants from unrelated donors he noted.|

After eight weeks of treatment with electroacupuncture -- acupuncture involving electrical stimulation -- study participants experienced significant symptom and quality-of-life improvements the study found. Electroacupuncture uses thin needles inserted beneath the skin that are attached to a device that sends electric pulses into the body. The study findings suggest a safe and effective option for difficult-to-treat patients several gastroenterologists said. "It is heartening to see such rigorously tested alternative therapies since so many of them are administered without any evidence to support them" said Dr. Christopher Andrews. He's a clinical associate professor in the gastroenterology division at University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine in Canada. Dr. Henry Parkman a professor of medicine at Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia said: "This seems to be a good treatment for the refractory patients -- those not responding to conventional medical treatments." The study involved people with chronic severe "functional" constipation. These people have difficult infrequent bowel movements -- no more than two per week -- not due to other medical conditions or medicines they may be taking such as opioid painkillers.  For the study the researchers randomly assigned 1075 patients to one of two groups. Half received electroacupuncture with needles that pierced the muscle layer of the abdominal wall. The other half received "sham" treatments with shallow needles at points not considered therapeutic in acupuncture (the "control" group).  Acupuncturists at 15 Chinese hospitals administered the real and sham treatments consisting of 28 half-hour sessions. Over the eight-week treatment period 31 percent of patients in the electroacupuncture group had three or more bowel movements in a week on average. Only 12 percent of patients in the control group achieved that level of relief. Bowel movements of three per day to three per week are considered within the range of "normal" according to the American College of Gastroenterology. The effects persisted well after treatment. Almost 38 percent of electroacupuncture patients reported three or more bowel movements a week on average during the study's 12-week follow-up period compared to 14 percent of sham therapy patients.|

Biologics are medications made from living cells. They are complicated to manufacturer and companies that make brand-name versions say cheaper generic versions aren't interchangeable with their products. The patents of many brand-name biologics are expiring and the use of generic versions (called biosimilars) could save patients and the healthcare system significant amounts of money the Johns Hopkins University researchers noted. "The billion-dollar question has been whether these 'generic biologics' are the same as the brand-name versions" study leader Dr. G. Caleb Alexander said in a university news release. "The same debate occurred with the advent of less complicated generic drugs and now it's being hashed out all over again with much more at stake -- more room for error and more potential for cost savings to the health system" he explained. "But based on the available evidence we conclude that the products we studied appear comparable and they will definitely be cheaper" Alexander said. He's an associate professor in the department of Epidemiology at the Bloomberg School of Public Health and co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore. He and his colleagues reviewed 19 studies. The studies were conducted through April 2016. The research looked at the use of generic and brand-name biologic drugs called tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors to treat rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. The study focused only on tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. Further research is needed to determine whether other types of generic biologics -- such as cancer drugs and insulin -- work as well as their brand-name versions Alexander said. "Biologics are the wave of the future. That's where more and more of the pharmaceutical market is going in the years ahead" Alexander says. The findings appear Aug. 1 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.|

Twenty-eight of the sunscreens did not deliver the promised SPF level says Trisha Calvo CR's deputy editor of health and food. And two products claiming an SPF of 50 actually weighed in with an SPF of 8 according to test results. This year's report includes ratings of lotions sprays sticks and facial sunscreens and reviews both adult and children's formulas. It also includes commonly asked questions about sunscreens such as what SPF (sun protection factor) and ''broad spectrum'' are. It will be published in the July issue of Consumer Reports magazine. Seventeen sunscreens earned a spot on the organization’s “recommended” list. "I think there are a lot of really good sunscreens on the market" Calvo says. The testing uses volunteers who soak in water after the sunscreens are applied and then have their skin exposed to UV light. The Personal Care Products Council a group that includes sunscreen makers questioned the process and say that their products meet FDA requirements and their own testing. Two products earned a perfect score: La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Melt-in Sunscreen Milk lotion with an SPF of 60 is priced at $7.20 an ounce. And Trader Joe's Spray with an SPF of 50-plus costs $6 for 6 ounces. The other 15 making the recommended list are:|

Red meat intake -- in this case mostly pork -- was strongly associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease the loss of normal kidney function. The relationship was also "dose dependent" -- meaning the higher the consumption the greater the risk.  The association held up even after compensating for factors that could skew the results such as lifestyle and other health conditions the study authors noted. "Our findings suggest that patients with chronic kidney disease or the general population worried about their kidney health can still maintain protein intake but consider switching to plant-based sources" said Dr. Woon-Puay Koh professor in the Office of Clinical Sciences at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore.  "However if they still choose to eat meat fish/shellfish and poultry are better alternatives to red meat" said Koh one of the study's authors. The study adds new data to a conflicting body of evidence on the relationship between protein intake particularly red meat and kidney disease experts noted. "It adds useful and additional information to our knowledge base but I'm not sure if it necessarily tips the scale one way or another" said Dr. Allon Friedman a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. "My opinion is that it's still perfectly fine for individuals who are otherwise healthy to consume red meat in moderation" he said. Dr. William Mitch professor of nephrology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston said plenty of studies have shown that low-protein diets may benefit people who already have kidney damage.  However "in the general population there's no persuasive evidence that eating a lot of protein causes kidney damage" he said. About 20 million Americans have chronic kidney disease according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Between 2000 and 2008 the number of new cases among people 65 and older more than doubled says the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. And while new cases have leveled off recent data from a federal registry show the number of people requiring kidney dialysis continues to rise.|

Now scientists say they've gained new insight into how the virus infects the fetus and a potential means of preventing infection. Zika can cause serious birth defects if a woman becomes infected while pregnant. Thousands of babies have been born in Brazil with abnormally small heads and brains a condition called microcephaly. "Very few viruses reach the fetus during pregnancy and cause birth defects" noted study lead researcher Lenore Pereira a professor of cell and tissue biology at the University of California San Francisco. Gaining a better understanding of how Zika does this "may be the most essential question for thinking about ways to protect the fetus when the mother gets infected" she said in a university news release. Based on work in the laboratory Pereira's team discovered that Zika infects numerous types of cells in the placenta and amniotic sac the fluid-filled sac that surrounds and protects the fetus in the womb. The virus also takes two distinct routes to reach a developing fetus. There is a placental route established in the first trimester of pregnancy or a route across the amniotic sac that only becomes available in the second trimester the research team reported. In their tests the researchers also found that an older antibiotic called duramycin effectively blocked the virus from replicating in the type of cells that they believe help transmit Zika along both routes. In prior lab work duramycin has been found to help fight off dengue and West Nile viruses which are flaviviruses -- the same group of viruses that comprises Zika. "Duramycin efficiently blocks infection of numerous placental cell types and intact first-trimester human placental tissue by contemporary strains of Zika virus recently isolated from the current outbreak in Latin America" study co-author Eva Harris said in the news release. She is professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California Berkeley's School of Public Health. Early science like this often fails to pan out in humans so more research is necessary. However Harris believes that "duramycin or similar drugs could effectively reduce or prevent transmission of Zika virus from mother to fetus across both potential routes and prevent associated birth defects."  The findings were published July 18 in the journal Cell Host & Microbe.|

Prince Rogers Nelson 57 died April 21 from an overdose of fentanyl a drug often used to quell pain in cancer patients when traditional opioids prove ineffective. Despite its legitimate medical uses fentanyl has acquired a growing reputation as a dangerous street drug thanks to at least a dozen synthetic variants now available to users according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). And fentanyl is only one of numerous synthetic opioids and designer drugs now flooding the illicit drug market in the United States DEA acting chief Chuck Rosenberg warned during a U.S. Senate hearing last week. "We are trying to keep up with a picture that changes almost every day" Rosenberg testified. "We've identified something like 400 new psychoactive substances over the last four or five years." Another synthetic opioid U-47700 has been connected to at least 50 deaths nationwide but is so new to the black market that the DEA has not yet moved to control it according to the Associated Press. Synthetic narcotics are dangerous because their potency can far outstrip traditional opioids. For example fentanyl is 25 to 40 times more potent than heroin and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine said Dr. Mitra Ahadpour. She is a medical officer with the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment in the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  Rosenberg testified that "fentanyl is so dangerous we've had to instruct our agents that if they touch it or inhale it accidentally they can die." Several states reported sharp increases in overdose deaths caused by fentanyl and its analogs in 2014 a health advisory from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted. Ohio reported 514 fentanyl-related deaths in 2014 compared to 92 in 2013 while Maryland had 185 fentanyl deaths in 2014 compared to 58 the year before.|

The drug -- Differin Gel 0.1% (adapalene) -- has been in use in a stronger form as a prescription acne treatment since 1996 the FDA said Friday. It is applied to the skin once a day and approved for people 12 and older.  "Millions of consumers from adolescents to adults suffer from acne" Dr. Lesley Furlong of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said in an agency news release. "Now consumers have access to a new safe and effective over-the-counter option." As many as 50 million people in the United States have acne the majority of them teenagers and young adults. The telltale pimples form when hair follicles of the skin clog up marring the face neck back chest and/or shoulders.  The common skin condition can cause scarring and lead to poor self-image depression and anxiety the FDA pointed out.  Retinoids which contain vitamin A-like chemicals are used to treat a variety of skin conditions. The FDA cautioned that women who are pregnant planning to become pregnant or breast-feeding should ask a doctor before using Differin Gel 0.1%. No well-controlled studies of the drug have been conducted in pregnant women and some other retinoid drugs have been shown to cause birth defects the agency said.  The gel's approval followed five clinical trials in people with mild to moderate acne. One study showed that absorption is limited a finding that supports over-the-counter use the FDA said.  Those using Differin Gel 0.1% should avoid sunburn. Also skin may become irritated during the first few weeks of use the agency said.  Dr. Doris Day is a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said "Differin Gel has had an excellent safety profile and will be a great addition to the over-the-counter options for those suffering with acne who are unable to get to a dermatologist." Day noted that the over-the-counter version is a lower concentration of the medication available by prescription at 0.3% strength. "You still need to be aware to see your dermatologist if the acne does not clear or if the acne is scarring" she added. "And it is very important to use sunscreen on a daily basis when using this product." Differin Gel 0.1% is distributed by Galderma Laboratories L.P. in Fort Worth Texas.|

In their study researchers at Yale University noted that while the male orgasm's role in getting the sperm to meet the egg has long been clear the female orgasm's role has been a mystery. It has no obvious role in the success of reproduction or in the number of children so scientists have long tried to determine why women have orgasms said a team led by Yale professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Gunter Wagner.  He and co-researcher Mihaela Pavlicev of Cincinnati Children's Hospital studied other mammals for clues into how the female orgasm evolved. They looked at non-human mammals and focused on a specific reflex that goes along with orgasms in women -- release of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin. In many mammals this orgasm-linked reflex plays a role in ovulation -- specifically helping to stimulate the release of eggs from the ovaries.  Despite the fact that mammals vary widely today this trait may have been necessary to ovulation in species that were ancestral to humans. "This [orgasm-linked] reflex became superfluous for reproduction later in evolution freeing [human] female orgasm for secondary roles" according to a Yale news release. The study authors also noted that the clitoris appears to have shifted in anatomical position throughout evolution -- so that it now is less likely to be directly stimulated during intercourse. The study was published Aug. 1 in the journal JEZ-Molecular and Developmental Evolution.|

The clinical trial found that end-stage heart failure patients treated with stem cells harvested from their own bone marrow had 37 percent fewer cardiac events than those who received a "dummy" placebo. "For the last 15 years everyone has been talking about cell therapy and what it can do. These results suggest that it really works" study author and cardiac surgeon Dr. Amit Patel director of Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City said in a university news release. Another expert was cautiously optimistic about the results. While the findings are promising "further long-term data -- and hopefully improved levels of heart efficiency and performance -- would still need to be seen" said Dr. David Friedman chief of heart failure services at Northwell Health Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital. In heart failure a weakened or damaged heart no longer pumps blood the way it should. This potentially fatal disease affects about 5.7 million Americans according to the American Heart Association. The new study involved 126 heart failure patients. Sixty received the stem cell treatment while the other 66 got a placebo. After one year 4 percent of the stem cell therapy patients had died and about 52 percent had been hospitalized for heart failure. That was an improvement on the group receiving the placebo where 8 percent of patients died and more than 82 percent ended up in the hospital Patel's team said. "This is the first trial of cell therapy showing that it can have a meaningful impact on the lives of patients with heart failure" Patel added. If further studies are successful stem cell therapy may one day offer an alternative to current treatments for end-stage heart failure such as heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy the researchers said. The study was published online April 4 in The Lancet journal and presented simultaneously at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) in Chicago.|
Tue Oct 11 15:26:22 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/WVzG6UaFoT, | Americans Are Changing Their Supplements of Choice|, |['Vitamin D' 'D vitamins' 'fish oil' 'fish oil supplements' 'omega 3' 'multivitamins' 'vitamins' 'supplements'] |, |TUESDAY Oct. 11 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Traditional multivitamins are falling out of favor among Americans while supplements such as vitamin D fish oil and probiotics are gaining ground a new study finds. Researchers found that between 1999 and 2012 Americans' overall use of supplements remained stable. Slightly more than half of adults said they took vitamins minerals or some other type of dietary supplement. What's changed are the products of choice. Multivitamins and many individual vitamins and minerals are less popular as are botanicals such as echinacea ginseng and garlic extracts the investigators found. On the other hand more people are using vitamin D omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics -- "good" bacteria said to benefit the digestive system. Researchers said the findings make sense. "I did expect to see that vitamin D use would go up and that fish oil would go up" said lead researcher Elizabeth Kantor an epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. That's because both have been the focus of a lot of research and media attention in recent years Kantor pointed out. Some studies but not all have suggested fish oil pills can curb the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular trouble. And studies have hinted that vitamin D could be protective against a range of ills from cancer to diabetes to multiple sclerosis -- though clinical trials testing those ideas have yet to be finished. The drop in multivitamin use was less expected Kantor said. But it also makes sense she added. During the study period a number of studies questioned the value of multivitamins when it comes to preventing major health conditions. Similarly antioxidants -- such as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene -- were once a hot topic. Early studies suggested they might battle ills like heart disease and cancer. But clinical trials later found either no benefit or even potential harm from antioxidants Kantor's team pointed out in the new report. The current findings are based on almost 38000 U.S. adults who took part in a nationally representative government health survey between 1999 and 2012.|

Now a new study sheds light on another repercussion — how this public health problem is adding to the nation’s ballooning health care costs and who’s shouldering that burden. The research comes as policymakers grapple with how to curb the increased abuse of these drugs known as opioids. State legislators in New York Connecticut Alaska and Pennsylvania have tried to take action by adding new resources to boost prevention and treatment. In addition President Barack Obama laid out strategies last month intended to improve how the health system deals with addiction. Published Monday in the journal Health Affairs the study measures how many people were hospitalized between 2002 and 2012 because they were abusing heroin or prescription painkillers and how many of them got serious infections related to their drug use. It also tracks what hospitals charged to treat those patients and how the hospitals were paid. The findings? Hospitalizations related to use and dependence on opioids have skyrocketed from about 302000 in 2002 to about 520000 a decade later. During the same time period the number of these patients who had dangerous infections like endocarditis or septic arthritis increased from about 3400 to 6535. Those tallies are likely higher now given the continued growth in opioid abuse said Matthew Ronan a hospitalist at the Veterans Health Administration in Boston an instructor at Harvard Medical School and the study’s primary author. Meanwhile those same patients are becoming more expensive to treat. Hospitals charged almost $15 billion in 2012 for opioid-related inpatient care — more than double what they billed in 2002 even after accounting for inflation. More than $700 million of that went to treating patients with the associated infections. And many were uninsured or on Medicaid the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. “We’re certainly seeing the bad outcomes of IV drug use whether that’s death or hospitalization” Ronan said. “It’s a pretty destitute population and a population that doesn’t have a lot of resources. You can only imagine that the bills are going to be huge.”|

Women experienced these benefits by sticking to the guidelines of the Paleo diet even though they were not required to restrict their calorie intake the researchers said. The study results indicate that the Paleo diet could prove an effective means of battling the obesity epidemic said lead study author Caroline Blomquist a doctoral student at Umea University in Sweden. The findings are scheduled for presentation Sunday at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston. The data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. "Obesity-related disorders have reached pandemic proportions with significant economic burden on a global scale" Blomquist said in a prepared statement. "It is of vital interest to find effective methods to improve metabolic balance." A Paleo diet requires people to eat foods similar to those available to humans during the Paleolithic period which dates from 10000 to 2.5 million years ago according to the Mayo Clinic. The diet typically includes foods that could be obtained by hunting and gathering -- lean meats fish fruits vegetables nuts and seeds -- and limits foods that became common with the advent of farming such as dairy products grains and legumes. In this study Blomquist and her colleagues had 35 postmenopausal women who were obese but had normal blood sugar levels follow a Paleo diet for two years. The group aimed to consume 30 percent of their daily energy intake from protein 30 percent from carbohydrates and 40 percent from fats mainly made up of "good" unsaturated fats. The diet used in the study included lean meat fish eggs vegetables fruits nuts and berries with rapeseed olive oils and avocado as additional fat sources. It excluded dairy products cereals added salt and refined fats and sugar. An outside expert noted that the study diet was a modified one that veers slightly from a strict Paleo diet.|

Researchers found no change in mental ability associated with estrogen therapy among women who used it after menopause no matter when they started taking it.  "There is no important benefit there is no important risk cognitively associated with the use of hormone therapy over at least five years" said lead researcher Dr. Victor Henderson. He is a professor of health research and policy and neurology and neurological science at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto Calif. "If a postmenopausal woman is considering taking hormone therapy with the thought that it might improve memory or other aspects of cognition she should know that there is no evidence that it does benefit cognition" he said. Some studies have suggested that hormone therapy protected cognition (thinking skills) and some animal studies suggested that the timing of hormone therapy was important. But neither of these appear to matter Henderson said. Over the long term the use of hormone therapy may even have a negative effect on mental ability researchers have found. Henderson said the long-running U.S. health study known as the Women's Health Initiative found that hormone therapy among older women increased the risk for dementia. In the new study by Henderson and colleagues nearly 570 healthy women aged 41 to 84 were randomly assigned to take estradiol or an inactive placebo every day. Estradiol is the main type of estrogen produced by women in their reproductive years. In addition the women were divided into two groups: an early menopause group (within six years of their last period); and a late group (at least 10 years after menopause). The women also used a vaginal progesterone gel or placebo gel unless they had had a hysterectomy. The average treatment lasted nearly five years. The investigators tested the verbal memory and thinking skills of the participants at the beginning of the trial 2.5 years later and five years later.|

But a panel of U.S. medical experts has concluded there's no proof the dreaded checkup benefits healthy women who aren't pregnant. In a draft recommendation released Tuesday the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said it couldn't weigh in for or against routine pelvic exams based on current evidence. "The Task Force is calling for more research to better understand the benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic exams in women without any complaints or symptoms" said Dr. Francisco Garcia a task force member. He is director and chief medical officer of the Pima County Department of Health in Tucson Ariz. The task force statement applies only to symptom-free non-pregnant women. Women should still be screened for cervical cancer -- every three years from ages 21 to 29 and every five years from ages 30 to 65. Sexually active women should also be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia the task force said. "Women with gynecologic symptoms or concerns should discuss them with their clinicians" said task force member Dr. Maureen Phipps chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence R.I. Women all over will likely rejoice if the periodic exam falls by the wayside. Clothed only in a surgical gown with their feet elevated in surgical stirrups patients endure prodding and poking while a doctor explores the vagina cervix uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries. Nearly 63 million pelvic exams were performed in the United States in 2010 according to the task force. But it found "insufficient" data to support their value. What evidence there is may be of poor or conflicting quality the task force statement said. While no studies evaluated the exam's ability to prevent disease or death research did turn up harms such as unnecessary surgeries caused by "false positive" test results the task force noted. Other influential medical groups have also questioned the value of annual pelvic exams. The American College of Physicians in 2014 recommended discontinuing routine pelvic exams because of little evidence of benefit.|

The finding suggests that "young children remain highly exposed to TV advertisements for foods that may contribute to unhealthy dietary patterns" said a team led by Jennifer Emond. She's an assistant professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth College in Hanover N.H.  Obesity remains a threat to the health of many American children. And Emond's team pointed out that "energy-dense nutritionally poor foods" continue to be aggressively marketed to very young children. Indeed the average preschooler is exposed to more than three hours of television each day and "preschoolers viewed 18 percent more TV snack food advertisements from 2010 to 2014" the researchers said. Does such advertising "work" to get these youngsters to eat more unhealthy snacks? To find out Emond's team monitored 60 kids aged 2 to 5 from New Hampshire and Vermont as they watched a 14-minute segment of "Sesame Street." The preschoolers got a filling snack before the show -- so they were not hungry -- and then had unlimited access to snacks during it. Some of the children watched the "Sesame Street" segment without food commercials while others watched the show with commercials for a popular salty snack. The ads depicted kids happily playing and eating the snack. The result: Children who watched the snack commercial "consumed on average 29.5 kilocalories more" food afterwards and "the main effect was driven by a greater consumption of the advertised food" Emond's team wrote. The researchers believe this shows that food ads prompt kids to eat even when they're not hungry. Limiting food commercials targeted to children could help kids eat more healthily and consume fewer unneeded calories the study authors contended. Dr. Allison Stakovsky is a pediatrician at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park N.Y. She said the new findings mirror previous research. "We already know that television viewing is an important environmental influence on the development of obesity" she said. "Kids who watch more television are more likely to be overweight. Kids who have a television in their bedroom are more likely to be overweight.|
Wed Jul 27 13:08:32 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/9UQ5M0FLLr, | Is a New at-Home Colon Cancer Test for You?|, |['cologuard' 'colon cancer test' 'colorectal cancer test' 'at home test' 'colonoscopy'] |, |July 27 2016 -- Up to 40% of people who should get a test for colon cancer aren’t doing so. That’s one of the reasons why some doctors are encouraged by Cologuard a new at-home test for colon cancer. The mail-away DNA stool test for colon cancer is covered by Medicare and an influential federal task force just included it on a list of recommended ways to look for the disease. However at $649 it’s more expensive than older tests that look for signs of colorectal cancer in a stool sample. It doesn’t have the established track record of older tests and it won’t find growths in the colon the way a colonoscopy will. But when millions of people aren’t getting tested for one of the most common and preventable forms of cancer doctors say its convenience may help close that gap. “Of course as a gastroenterologist I prefer a colonoscopy” says Carol Burke MD vice chair of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Cleveland Clinic. “But the bottom line is 40% of the population hasn’t been screened. This is a preventable disease.” Doctors consider colonoscopy the best way to look for colon cancer since it can find and remove nearly all abnormal growths. But the dreaded “prep” can take a day or two and involves cleaning out the colon with laxatives. During the procedure doctors insert a camera-equipped probe into the colon to look at its inner lining. The test can cost more than $2000 without insurance although it’s usually covered as a screening test. Unlike older stool tests that look for traces of blood -- a potential warning sign of colorectal cancer --Cologuard looks for abnormal cells associated with cancer and precancerous polyps. Patients receive a test kit pack up a stool sample at home and mail it to the company’s laboratory which sends the results to the patient’s doctor. The FDA approved it in August 2014 after a study of nearly 10000 people conducted by the test’s manufacturer Wisconsin-based Exact Sciences. In that study Cologuard detected 92% of colorectal tumors and 42% of precancerous growths.|

America's highways are already more than mean enough according to a new study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. Nearly 8 of 10 drivers demonstrated significant anger aggression or road rage in the past year the study found. They admitted to tailgating confronting other motorists and even hitting other cars on purpose. "Inconsiderate driving bad traffic and the daily stresses of life can transform minor frustrations into dangerous road rage" Jurek Grabowski the foundation's director of research said in a AAA news release. "Far too many drivers are losing themselves in the heat of the moment and lashing out in ways that could turn deadly." Anger or road rage provokes a number of risky behaviors. The study found about half of drivers or roughly 100 million people have tailgated or yelled at another motorist. About 45 percent honk their horn when they are mad; 33 percent make rude gestures; 24 percent block another car from changing lanes; 12 percent cut off other cars; and 4 percent have gotten out of their car to confront someone. The researchers also found that 3 percent -- nearly 6 million people -- have bumped or rammed another car on purpose due to road rage. Most motorists believe aggressive driving has gotten worse in recent years and threatens their personal safety. Road rage is more common among men between the ages of 19 and 39. Drivers in the Northeast are also much more likely to yell honk or gesture out of anger than those elsewhere in the United States. Road rage is also more common among those who also speed or run red lights according to the study published July 14.  "It's completely normal for drivers to experience anger behind the wheel but we must not let our emotions lead to destructive choices" Jake Nelson AAA's director of traffic safety advocacy and research said in the news release. "Don't risk escalating a frustrating situation because you never know what the other driver might do. Maintain a cool head and focus on reaching your destination safely" Nelson added. AAA offers these tips for preventing road rage:|

In 1970 the drug received FDA approval for use in people and was used on American soldiers in Vietnam as an analgesic and sedative. However doctors became reluctant to use it because it caused minor hallucinogenic side effects. If the new use gets the go-ahead from the FDA it would be the first new treatment for major depression approved in about half a century according to CNN.|

"We think that this study sends a powerful public health message: that a complete lack of exercise is associated with the greater likelihood of developing a serious disease" said senior study author Kirsten Moysich. She is a distinguished professor of oncology in the department of cancer prevention and control at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo N.Y. "Our findings show that any amount of exercise can reduce cervical cancer risk" Moysich said in a Roswell release.  According to study author Dr. J. Brian Szender the researchers believe that "this is the first U.S.-based study looking at the associations between physical inactivity and cervical cancer." Szender is a fellow in the department of gynecologic oncology at Roswell.  "Our findings suggest that abstinence from regular physical activity is associated with increased odds of cervical cancer" he added although a cause-and-effect link was not proven. The study involved 128 women diagnosed with cervical cancer as well as 512 women who were suspected of having cervical cancer but ultimately were found not to have the disease. Of those diagnosed with cervical cancer 31 percent of the women reported being inactive. In this study physical inactivity was defined as exercising less than four times a month. Even after the researchers considered other risk factors -- such as smoking alcohol intake family history of cervical cancer and body mass index -- these women were 2.5 times more likely to develop cervical cancer than women who exercised the findings showed. Meanwhile 26 percent of the women who had been suspected of having cervical cancer reported being inactive the investigators found. "In addition to smoking cessation and undergoing regular screening we have identified another important modifiable risk factor for this disease" Moysich said. The findings were published in the May issue of the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease.|

In this year's Medscape compensation report more docs are saying they'd choose medicine again than they did 2 years ago. The highest percentages are among family physicians and internists who tend to earn less than most doctor groups. More women are entering the profession and their income is rising at a higher rate than that of the men. The trend toward higher employment numbers particularly among younger doctors may be taking some of the stress off the profession. Nearly 19200 physicians participated in this year’s survey. The doctor groups at the bottom and top of the earnings list have not changed much over the past 6 years. In this year’s report Medscape’s sixth annual the lowest earners starting from last place are pediatricians ($204000) endocrinologists ($206000) and family physicians ($207000). In 2010 those groups were also in the bottom three. The top three earners this year are orthopedists ($443000) cardiologists ($410000) and dermatologists ($381000). In the 2011 report orthopedists were also first followed by radiologists anesthesiologists and then cardiologists. Dermatologists were eighth 6 years ago. In our 2016 report men still earn more than women whether they are primary care doctors ($225000 vs. $192000 respectively) or specialists ($324000 vs. $242000 respectively). But women's earnings increased more between 2012 and 2015 than did men's: 40% for female primary care doctors and 34% for their male peers. For specialists the percentage increases between those years were 36% for women and 29% for men. Overall female doctors make 24% less than their male peers do although the disparity is less among primary care doctors (15%) than among specialists (25%). This year the highest earnings were reported in the North Central ($296000) and Southeast ($287000) regions whereas the lowest were in the Northeast ($266000) and Mid-Atlantic ($268000) regions. Uneven distribution of doctors particularly in primary care has been a problem for decades in rural and poor communities. Numerous government policies are aimed at improving access to doctors in these areas. As a result higher incomes are found in these regions.|

Using imaging scans researchers spotted "microstructural" changes in the white brain matter of 25 male athletes aged 8 to 13 after a season of football. They also found that players experienced more significant brain changes if they took a greater number of hits and stronger hits to the head said lead researcher Dr. Christopher Whitlow. He's chief of neuroradiology at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem N.C. "We're seeing some associations between the amount of change in the brain and the amount of exposure to head impacts" Whitlow said. "The more exposure they've had the more change you see." However Whitlow was quick to add that these changes are imperceptible to the naked eye and future research might prove these changes harmless. "Football is a very physical sport so there are lots of changes in the body after a season of football" he said. "Players have cuts and bruises and after the season these go away. Perhaps the change we're seeing is just another one of those physical manifestations of playing a season of football that will just go away." Nearly 3 million youth players participate in tackle football programs across the United States. And there are about 2000 active National Football League players Whitlow noted. Whitlow said he and his colleagues were particularly concerned about the impacts to the head that don't lead to a concussion. The brains of youth and high school football players are still undergoing rapid development and repeated hits that don't result in brain injury still might have an effect that adds up over time the researchers said. To study this the research team recruited 25 participants from a local youth football team during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. At the beginning of the season players had an advanced MRI scan performed on their brain. They also were provided helmets embedded with sensors that measure the severity of every hit to the head that occurs during play.|

A new study found that medicines taken by millions for depression asthma allergies and other conditions may raise that risk. The drugs involved in the study are known as anticholinergics. They work by blocking a brain chemical called acetylcholine which is crucial for memory. Although this isn’t the first time researchers have looked at this link the new study looked at about 100 over-the-counter and prescription drugs that work in this way ranging from the antidepressant Paxil (paroxetine) to the allergy drug Benadryl (diphenhydramine) to the motion sickness remedy Dramamine (dimenhydrinate). The experts found a strong link between the drugs and dementia but they didn't prove the meds directly cause it. WebMD asked the lead researcher on the recent study and an expert on Alzheimer's disease to help people taking the drugs understand what to know and do.  What did this study actually show regarding these drugs and dementia? The brains of those people taking the medicine did not work as well as the brains of those not taking them. "We saw an increased risk of getting dementia over time" says researcher Shannon Risacher PhD assistant professor of radiology and imaging sciences at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Older adults who took the drugs had poorer thinking skills than those not taking them she says. Their brains were also smaller especially in the areas important for memory and other thinking skills. The researchers looked at the brains of 451 men and women with 60 taking one or more of the anticholinergics medicines. Their average age was 73 and they had normal thinking skills and brain volume. Study participants took the medicines on average for about 7 years. Overall the researchers found that those on the medicines were ''four times more likely to develop either mild cognitive impairment [which often develops into dementia] or dementia'' than those not taking the medicines. The brain problems developed over a time frame ranging from 6 months to about 8 years Risacher says.|

"Some [folate] is a good thing. It does appear the levels in the body could get too high and that would be a bad thing" she said. "Supplementation is indeed an important thing" Fallin added. "We would not want anyone to interpret from this that they should stop taking vitamin supplements if they are intending to get pregnant or if they are pregnant." In the study mothers who had very high blood levels of folate at delivery were twice as likely to have a child with autism compared to mothers with normal folate levels. Researchers also found that mothers with excessive B12 levels were three times as likely to have a child with autism. The risk was greatest among mothers who had excess levels of both folate and B12 -- their risk was over 17 times that of a mother with normal levels of both nutrients the investigators reported. However the study only found an association and could not prove that high levels caused an increased risk of autism. The study findings are scheduled for presentation Friday at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Baltimore. Folate is found naturally in fruits and vegetables while the synthetic version folic acid is used to fortify cereals and breads in the United States and in vitamin supplements. However expecting mothers shouldn't toss away their supplements the researchers stressed. The study also found that women who took folate and B12 supplements three to five times a week were less likely overall to have a child with autism particularly when they're taken during the first and second trimesters Fallin said.|

The BRCA1 gene mutation is already well known for significantly increasing the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. In fact the risk is so high that some women consider having both breasts as well as their ovaries removed to prevent breast and ovarian cancers the researchers noted. This latest study is the first to find a conclusive link between the mutation and a slight increase in the odds of developing an aggressive uterine cancer the researchers said. The study authors looked at data from nearly 1100 U.S. women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. The women were from the United States and the United Kingdom. Their health was followed for a median of about five years. BRCA2 also raises the risk of breast and ovarian cancers according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute. During the research period eight of the women in the study were diagnosed with uterine cancer a rate that's slightly higher but not statistically different than for women in the general population. However five of those cancers were an uncommon and highly aggressive type called serous endometrial cancer. Four out of five of those cancers occurred in women with the BRCA1 mutation the study showed. "We were surprised when we saw the data" study author Dr. Noah Kauff head of the Clinical Cancer Genetics Program at the Duke Cancer Institute said in a university news release. "This is an event that should not occur in the over 600 women with BRCA1 mutations in our study. Even if we followed these women for 25 years you would only expect to see no more than one serous cancer" he explained. The study was published online June 30 in the journal JAMA Oncology. The findings could help women with the BRCA1 mutation and their doctors make treatment decisions the researchers said. "Our findings suggest that it may be important for women with BRCA1 mutations to consider removing their uterus at the time they are considering removing their ovaries and fallopian tubes unless they are hoping to still have children using assisted reproductive methods or have other medical reasons" Kauff said.|

Women are now nearly on par with men in alcohol consumption and the ill effects drinking has on health a worldwide review finds. Historically men have been far more likely than women to drink alcohol and to drink so much it affects their health. Older studies suggested as much as a 12-fold difference between the sexes the researchers said. Recent data suggests that the gap has closed. Women across the globe are now nearly as likely as men to drink and to engage in excessive harmful drinking said lead researcher Tim Slade. He's an epidemiologist with the National Drug and Alcohol Research Center at the University of New South Wales in Australia. "We can no longer think of alcohol use and alcohol-related harms as problems that just affect men" Slade said. To track trends in drinking between the genders Slade and his colleagues pooled data from more than 4 million people who were part of 68 international studies. These studies were published between 1980 and 2014. The studies included data collected between 1948 and 2014 representing people born as far back as 1891. The researchers focused on three categories: any alcohol use excessive use and health and social problems related to drinking. Men born between 1891 and 1910 were twice as likely as their female counterparts to drink alcohol. People born between 1991 and 2000 were about equally likely to drink the researchers found. At the same times the gender gap for excessive drinking fell from 3 times higher for men to 1.2 times. The gender gap for harms associated with drinking fell from 3.6 times higher for men to 1.3 times the researchers reported. After accounting for potential bias the researchers concluded that the gender gap for drinking fell by 3.2 percent with each successive five-year generation but was steepest among those born from 1966 onward.|

A series of blood samples showed kids younger than 6 were nearly 50 percent more likely to have elevated blood lead levels when the city used the Flint River for drinking water instead of the Detroit water system researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded.  The percentage of kids with high lead content returned to previous levels once the city switched back to the Detroit system. The reason for the lead contamination? Inappropriate corrosion control measures investigators said.  "This crisis was entirely preventable and a startling reminder of the critical need to eliminate all sources of lead from our children's environment" Patrick Breysse director of CDC's National Center for Environmental Health said in an agency news release.  Even low levels of lead in children's blood can affect intelligence ability to pay attention and academic achievement the agency noted.  The blood lead level of concern is 5 or more micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood. During the period that the Flint River water was used (April 25 2014 to Oct. 15 2015) lead levels in local tap water increased over time as did lead content in children's blood the CDC said.  The CDC has advised that all children under age 6 in Flint have their blood tested for lead by a health care provider.  According to Dr. Nicole Lurie U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response "Parents and teachers can do a lot to help children grow up healthy and strong even if they were exposed to lead."  She said the city's children are getting developmental assessments and needed services. "We have also expanded Medicaid and strongly urge parents to enroll their children and schedule appointments for them to be seen by a health provider who can follow their health as they grow and develop" Lurie said.|

But those who play in youth football leagues are the most likely to get back on the field less than 24 hours after a concussion the researchers discovered. "The finding related to return-to-play under 24 hours being the highest in the youth level is surprising but may be the result of young football players struggling to identify concussion symptoms and express how they feel [to coaches or trainers]" explained lead researcher Zachary Kerr from the Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention in Indianapolis. With mounting evidence suggesting that concussions that happen earlier in life have a cumulative effect on the developing brain finding ways to better spot and treat these serious head injuries in younger players is more pressing than ever. For the study Kerr and his colleagues analyzed data from three injury programs. They found that more than 1400 sports-related concussions were reported among youth high school and college football players from 2012 to 2014. The most common symptoms reported were headache dizziness and difficulty concentrating. Overall about 15 percent of players did not return to play for at least 30 days after a concussion while 3 percent returned to play less than 24 hours after being injured the researchers found. The study found that high school football players had the highest average number of reported symptoms of concussion (5.60) followed by college athletes (5.56) and younger players (4.76). For high school players the likelihood of returning to play at least 30 days after concussion was higher (19.5 percent) than younger players (just over 16 percent) or college football players (7 percent) the researchers found. The researchers suggested biological factors such as puberty and brain development may explain the differences in recovery time among the age groups. Meanwhile the youngest players were the most likely to return to play less than 24 hours after suffering a concussion (10 percent) followed by college (close to 5 percent) and high school players (just under 1 percent) Kerr added.|
Tue Apr 12 16:39:46 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/A0AeQVF11b, | Doctors Often Overestimate Promise of New Drugs|, |['drugs' 'approved drugs' 'breakthrough designation' 'medications' 'fda' 'food and drug administration' 'doctors' 'prescribing'] |, |TUESDAY April 12 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Use of the word "breakthrough" in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's expedited approval process could mislead doctors about the new drugs' actual benefits researchers warn. The U.S. Congress in 2012 gave FDA the power to designate a drug as a "breakthrough therapy" if preliminary clinical evidence suggests an advantage over existing medications. But a survey of nearly 700 doctors revealed that many tended to misinterpret "breakthrough." Doctors often believed the drugs were supported by stronger evidence than the law requires to achieve that designation said lead author Dr. Aaron Kesselheim. He is a faculty member at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "When people hear 'breakthrough' it gives them an inappropriately elevated sense of what the drug might do" Kesselheim said. "It may give physicians false reassurance about the outcomes they might expect to receive when they prescribe it." In the survey nine out of 10 doctors chose one hypothetical drug over another identical one solely based on the "breakthrough" designation even though both were taken on the same schedule had similar side effects and were equally covered by the patient's insurance. In addition 52 percent incorrectly believed that strong evidence from randomized trials is needed to earn the breakthrough designation the researchers found. "They thought when a drug is labeled as a breakthrough therapy it actually is a breakthrough and that's not necessarily the case" Kesselheim said. "Many drugs labeled as breakthrough therapies are not true breakthroughs because they don't provide substantially advanced treatment over what's already available." The results were published April 12 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The FDA designated 76 drugs as "breakthrough therapies" through April 2015 the researchers noted but very few have had a major impact on the health of Americans. "It would be great if all of those drugs actually were breakthroughs but the likelihood of that is very small" Kesselheim said. Dr. Robert Wergin chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians agreed there can be confusion over the use of the word "breakthrough."|

Researchers examined data from more than 45000 men in Sweden who did compulsory military training in 1969-1970 and were followed until 2011. About 4000 of the men died during the 42-year study period. Those who were heavy marijuana users in their late teens were 40 percent more likely to die by age 60 than those who never used the drug the investigators found. But the study did not prove that early and heavy marijuana use led to an early death. The findings were published online April 22 in the American Journal of Psychiatry. A previous study of the same group of men showed no link between marijuana use and death. But because this new study covered a longer period (42 years) the men had reached ages when the harmful effects of previous marijuana use -- such as cancer lung and heart disease -- were more likely to have developed the researchers said. Interestingly the risk of death from either accidental injury or suicide among the men rose in accordance with their level of marijuana use as teens researcher Dr. Edison Manrique-Garcia from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said in a journal news release.|
Fri Jul 01 12:33:07 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/isP3hLN07q, | Memory Loss: Normal or a Sign of Trouble?|, |['memory' 'memory problems' 'forgetfulness' 'dementia' "Alzheimer's" "Alzheimer's disease" 'remembering'] |, |THURSDAY June 30 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Mild memory lapses such as forgetting where you put your keys or reading glasses though worrisome are normal experts say. But certain memory problems -- such as putting your car keys in the fridge -- may indicate a more serious issue. So what kind of memory issue suggests the need for a medical assessment? Some examples include: memory loss that disrupts daily activities such as balancing a checkbook maintaining personal hygiene and driving; or frequent memory lapses such as regularly forgetting appointments or where you parked your car the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a news release. Other warning signs include forgetting whole conversations forgetting the names of relatives or close friends frequently repeating yourself or asking the same questions in the same conversation. Another red flag is memory loss that's getting worse over time. There are a number of things you can do that might help reduce the risk of developing memory problems: keeping cholesterol and blood pressure levels low; not smoking and not drinking too much alcohol; eating a healthy diet; engaging in lots of social activity; and keeping your brain active by reading writing learning a new skill playing games and gardening. There are a number of causes of memory loss including medications; heavy drinking; stress; depression; head injury; infections such as HIV tuberculosis syphilis and herpes; thyroid problems; lack of quality sleep; and low levels of vitamins B1 and B12. Many of these causes can be helped with medical treatment the FDA noted. "As part of the normal aging process it can be harder for some people to recall some types of information such as the names of individuals. Mild cognitive impairment however is a condition characterized by a memory deficit beyond that expected for age but is not sufficient to impair day-to-day activities" according to the news release.  Dementia is the most serious form of memory loss. Dementia causes increasing memory troubles and problems with other aspects of thinking. These difficulties are severe enough to impair the ability to do daily activities. Dementia has many causes but the most common is Alzheimer's disease researchers have found. Alzheimer's causes a progressive loss of brain cells that's accompanied by other abnormalities of the brain. About 5 million people in the United States have some form of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. That number is expected to nearly triple by 2050 according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.

Long used to smooth wrinkles botulinum toxin is made by a type of bacteria. The toxin blocks the release of substances at nerve endings reducing muscle contraction and the transmission of pain signals the researchers explained. The authors of the updated guideline reviewed scientific studies on the four preparations of botulinum toxin available in the United States. They concluded that the treatment is generally safe and effective for four neurological conditions: chronic migraine spasticity in adults cervical dystonia and blepharospasm. Chronic migraine is defined as having migraines 15 or more days a month the study authors explained. Spasticity in adults is muscle tightness that interferes with movement and typically occurs after a stroke spinal cord or other neurological injury. Cervical dystonia is a disorder of the brain that affects neck muscle control resulting in involuntary head tilt or neck movement. Blepharospasm is a movement disorder that causes the eyes to close uncontrollably guideline author Dr. David Simpson and colleagues said. Simpson is with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. The last time the guideline was updated -- in 2008 -- there wasn't enough information to make a recommendation on chronic migraine. This time the guideline authors found research that showed that botulinum toxin provides a small benefit for people with chronic migraines. The updated guideline was published online April 18 in the journal Neurology. The new guideline is also scheduled to be presented Monday at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Vancouver Canada.|

"An initial study of this drug showed an increased risk for cleft lip or cleft palate but a number of other studies since have not and our previous study showed an increased risk of clubfoot" said study author Helen Dolk of Ulster University in Northern Ireland. However the new study which had "a much larger population size -- more than double the size of our previous study" -- has found no significant links Dolk said in a news release from the journal Neurology. The research funded by the drug's maker Glaxo Smith Kline was published April 6 in the journal. In addition to being prescribed to control epileptic seizures lamotrigine is used to prevent mood swings in people with bipolar disorder the study authors said. Controlling epilepsy during pregnancy is important because seizures may harm the fetus the researchers noted. Dolk's team analyzed data on more than 10 million births over 16 years including almost 227000 babies with birth defects. Among those babies were 147 whose mothers took lamotrigine during the first trimester of pregnancy and had nongenetic birth defects. Babies born with cleft lip cleft palate or clubfoot were not significantly more likely than those with other birth defects to have been born to mothers who took lamotrigine in the first trimester of pregnancy the study found. In the general populations one in every 700 babies is born with cleft lip or cleft palate and nearly one in every 1000 is born with clubfoot. "We cannot exclude a small risk but we estimate the excess risk of cleft lip or cleft palate among babies exposed to the drug to be less than one in every 550 babies" Dolk said. "Since excess risks of cleft lip or palate have been reported for a variety of anti-epileptic drugs we recommend that for all mothers with epilepsy whatever their drug exposure special attention be given to examining the baby for cleft palate" she added.|

Acetaminophen (Tylenol Panadol) and ibuprofen (Advil Motrin) are often used to treat pain and fever. Some previous research has suggested that frequent use of acetaminophen may worsen asthma in kids with the respiratory condition. To investigate researchers studied 300 children between the ages of 1 and 5 with mild persistent asthma which is defined as having symptoms more than two days a week but not daily. All of the children used daily inhaled treatments to manage their asthma. During the study they received either acetaminophen or ibuprofen to treat pain or fever. The small percentage of kids whose asthma symptoms worsened was about the same with both medications according to the study published in the Aug. 18 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.  The findings could help guide the care of children with asthma according to the researchers. The research was led by Dr. William Sheehan of the divisions of allergy and immunology and respiratory diseases at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.|

The screening involves a blood test that identifies levels of PSA (prostate specific antigen) a protein produced by the prostate gland. That test can determine when cancer exists but it often wrongly identifies nonexistent cancer. These "false positive" results can cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary follow-up tests. Because of this the task force issued a draft recommendation against routine screening in 2011 and a final guideline in 2012. Since then diagnoses of early prostate cancer in American men aged 50 and older dropped by 19 percent between 2011 and 2012 and by another 6 percent the following year said lead researcher Dr. Ahmedin Jemal. He is vice president of the American Cancer Society's surveillance and health services research program. But while many men may have been spared unnecessary anguish less frequent screening may have a downside. Some experts worry more men will develop potentially fatal prostate cancer as a result. "Prostate cancer is a slow-growing tumor so it takes time. We may see it over the next three to five years" Jemal said. There is a balance in the task force recommendation said Dr. Anthony D'Amico chief of genitourinary radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. "Some men who should not be treated are not being diagnosed but that also means some men who should be treated are either losing the chance for cure or presenting later and needing to undergo more treatment and more side effects for a possible cure" he said. "The answer to this dilemma will come with personalized medicine based on risk-based screening -- screening men preferentially in good health and at high risk" D'Amico added.

Human skin encounters countless germs every day and researchers expected to find that the colonies of bacteria viruses and fungi in skin fluctuated over time. Instead they found the germs stay fairly constant. However skin hosts micro-environments which can either attract or repel germs. "We describe the difference between the sweaty armpit and the smooth forearm as being like a rain forest and a desert" said study co-author Julie Segre.  An analysis of skin samples finds feet in particular seem to change the most over time on the germ front said Segre a senior investigator with the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute.  The findings aren't likely to affect the ongoing debate about whether we're keeping ourselves too clean. These germs can live deep in the skin allowing them to remain unaffected by hand-washing said Segre.  Still the research does offer insight into the "baseline" of your skin she said allowing researchers to better understand how things go out of whack. Bacteria viruses and fungi cause conditions such as acne athlete's foot and warts. The skin's "microbiome" -- containing bacteria fungi and viruses -- is thought to be important to human health. Segre said it can help the body resist nasty germ invaders and maintain the barrier between the skin and inner organs. The new study aimed to discover how stable these skin germs are over time. This can help researchers understand what happens when skin disease develops Segre said. For the study Segre and colleagues analyzed 17 skin sites of 12 healthy volunteers three times over two years.  The researchers found that skin germs as a whole remained fairly steady although individuals have their own "microbial fingerprints." "One person had a higher amount of fungi on their skin another person had a lot of bacterial viruses on the side of their nose" Segre said. She thought these collections of germs might be temporary but "when we examined the person's skin community a year later it was still true."|

"We found that people in the study who had more positive attitudes toward aging were more resilient in response to stress -- meaning that there wasn't a significant increase in negative emotions" study author Jennifer Bellingtier a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University said in a university news release. "Meanwhile study participants with more negative attitudes toward aging showed a sharp increase in negative emotional affect on stressful days" she added. The study included 43 people aged 60 to 96. The participants were asked how they felt about aging and then completed a daily questionnaire for eight straight days. The questionnaire asked about levels of stress fear irritability or distress. According to study senior author Shevaun Neupert "This tells us that the way we think about aging has very real consequences for how we respond to difficult situations when we're older. That affects our quality of life and may also have health ramifications." Neupert is an associate professor of psychology at the university. "For example" she explained "more adverse emotional responses to stress have been associated with increased cardiovascular health risks." Bellingtier said the findings are likely applicable to other Americans. But it's not clear if the findings would be relevant in other cultures. "Attitudes toward aging vary widely across cultures and more work would need to be done to determine the importance of aging attitudes in other settings" she said. The findings were published online Aug. 3 in the Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences.|

THC was detected in some tests conducted with field kits and more definitive laboratory tests are underway according to sheriff's Capt. Michael Yowell the Associated Press reported. No illnesses have been linked to the town's water Lincoln County Public Health Director Susan Kelly said. There are indications that one of the town's five wells was tampered with but it's not known if the water was deliberately tainted according to Yowell. The FBI and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation are assisting in the case he added. Hugo has a population of about 730 and is located about 100 miles southeast of Denver the AP reported. Drinking THC-contaminated water is unlikely to cause lasting health effects according to Mark Salley a spokesman for the state Department of Public Health and Environment. The effects would depend on the concentration of THC in the water and how much and how quickly water was consumed he told the AP.|

The disease has been around since ancient times often surrounded by terrifying negative stigmas and tales of leprosy patients being shunned as outcasts. Outbreaks of leprosy have affected and panicked people on every continent. The oldest civilizations of China Egypt and India feared leprosy was an incurable mutilating and contagious disease. However leprosy is actually not that contagious. You can catch it only if you come into close and repeated contact with nose and mouth droplets from someone with untreated leprosy. Children are more likely to get leprosy than adults. Today about 180000 people worldwide are infected with leprosy according to the World Health Organization most of them in Africa and Asia. About 100 people are diagnosed with leprosy in the U.S. every year mostly in the South California Hawaii and some U.S. territories. Leprosy is caused by a slow-growing type of bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae). Leprosy is also known as Hansen's disease after the scientist who discovered M. leprae in 1873. Leprosy primarily affects the skin and the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord called the peripheral nerves. It may also strike the eyes and the thin tissue lining the inside of the nose. The main symptom of leprosy is disfiguring skin sores lumps or bumps that do not go away after several weeks or months. The skin sores are pale-colored.  Nerve damage can lead to: It usually takes about 3 to 5 years for symptoms to appear after coming into contact with the leprosy-causing bacteria. Some people do not develop symptoms until 20 years later. The time between contact with the bacteria and the appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period. Leprosy's long incubation period makes it very difficult for doctors to determine when and where a person with leprosy got infected. Leprosy is defined by the number and type of skin sores you have. Specific symptoms and treatment depend on the type of leprosy you have. The types are:|

Tue Jul 12 15:14:42 EDT 2016,   https://t.co/KpyKfaopTy, | Meds Prevent HIV Transmission With Unprotected Sex|, |['HIV' 'antiviral therapy' 'HIV treatment' 'condoms' 'unprotected sex'] |, |TUESDAY July 12 2016 (HealthDay News) -- HIV transmission is highly unlikely among straight couples who have sex without condoms when one partner carries the virus but takes medication new research suggests. For gay couples in the same scenario the risk seems to be only slightly higher. The Danish study had some major limitations. It only tracked couples for up to two years and there's no way to know if the risk of HIV transmission will grow over time as couples age. Also the HIV-positive participants were almost always careful to take their medication. And at least one AIDS prevention expert expressed some caution about the study's conclusions. Still "it [the study's findings] is really great news for patients and their partners" said HIV specialist Dr. Jared Baeten vice chair of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle. He was not involved with the study but is familiar with the findings.   "For so long patients have really cared deeply about the chance they would transmit this virus to people they love. What's very reassuring about this study and the bulk of information from other studies is that people who have HIV and are on treatment appear to have an incredibly low chance of passing on the virus" Baeten said. The new study is groundbreaking because it examines the risk of HIV transmission in couples who don't always use condoms. Most prior studies examined the risk in couples who used condoms said study co-author Dr. Jens Lundgren a professor of viral diseases at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In the study the researchers tracked 888 couples in which only one person was HIV-positive. The participants lived in 14 European countries and were followed for a median of slightly over a year between 2010 and 2014.  About two-thirds of the couples were heterosexual and the rest were gay males. The average age of those in all couples was 42 years. The study found that 11 partners became infected with HIV -- 10 gay men and one heterosexual. But the analysis of the virus in their bodies revealed that none were infected by their partners. Instead they'd contracted HIV by having sex outside their relationships; 33 percent of HIV-negative gay men reported having condomless sex with other partners compared to 4 percent of heterosexuals.|

Maybe a glass of wine with dinner or a shot of bourbon when the mood hits. Suddenly you break out in hives. Maybe you feel nauseous or start wheezing. Something is going on but it’s not necessarily an allergy to alcohol.  Allergies to alcohol are rare. Instead some ingredient or chemical in your drink could be the cause of your problem. This is often called alcohol intolerance. If you have it you may get: One of the most common symptoms of alcohol intolerance isn’t an allergic reaction at all. Redness of the face or flushing is particularly likely among Asian people. In a few cases alcohol intolerance can be a sign of a more serious problem. If you believe you have alcohol intolerance talk with your doctor and find out what’s causing it.  Alcoholic beverages are made from complex mixtures of grains chemicals and preservatives that your body needs to break down. If your body can’t do this effectively you will have a reaction. Common allergens in alcoholic beverages include: Histamines are a byproduct of fermentation and brewing so they’re in many alcoholic drinks. If you're a red wine drinker you should know that your drink of choice is more likely to cause a reaction than any other alcoholic beverage. Beer and whiskey can also cause reactions because both are made from four common allergens: yeast hops barley and wheat. You may have an intolerance to alcohol or allergic symptoms if: Be careful of any medication you may be taking. Check with your doctor.|
